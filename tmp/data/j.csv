Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,terminal 1 and the terminal 1 and the ,incorrect, Question: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 2 and the negative terminal,first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,incorrect,Detail: positive battery terminal is separated by a gap from terminal 1,first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,incorrect,:[Multiple correct answers are possible descriptions.] 1) With the positive end of our meter facing terminal 2. The negative test probe is in contact with Terminal 3 and produces a .6 voltage between terminals 1 for our example.),first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 2 and the positive terminal., he positive terminal.for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,incorrect,": This question provides full credit for an answer consistent with your lecture (standardized correct response) and little or no opportunity to receive partial credit on the basis of insightful reasoning, phrasing about topic incorrectly or missing important details.",3 Star,
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 6 and the positive terminal., terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,incorrect,": While terminal 6 will touch the positive eye of a volt meter, there is no metal-particle bridge to measure. Objective: Name & define symbols associated with electrical circuit analysis Comprehension questions : Clarification, identify main ideas The Explanation should be taught in conjunction with accompanying illustrations or diagrams",3 Star,dadadadadaadada
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 2., terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,incorrect,: These two terminals are connected so the voltage must be zero.,5 Star,the dasnadas bnavshoji
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 2., terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,incorrect,: Turns resistors R 1 â†’ R 2 except that they share the same (COMMON) terminal. In this case there is only one option - voltage across it will be zero! And thats what we verified with a multimeter -- reading of 0V,5 Star,the dasnadas bnavshoji
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4.,0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4,incorrect,Synonyms: . None of these. D,2 Star,NLP explanation is not working well so i am giving the 2 star for it.
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4.,0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4,incorrect,: Terminal 1 and terminal 4 are connected by a wire threaded through the fitting.,2 Star,NLP explanation is not working well so i am giving the 2 star for it.
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4.,0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4,incorrect,/Reference: 0 since the ball puts 4 volts across terminals 1 and 2 or 3 they are connected together,2 Star,NLP explanation is not working well so i am giving the 2 star for it.
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4.,0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4, incorrect," : Its a non radial capacitor so its smaller in size and having more bending surface area. Therefore it has an inverted polarizing voltage at two terminals , when you connect one terminal to ground or power supply then other end will have positive potential for that polarity . In the circuit here there is zero volts from wire element A",2 Star,NLP explanation is not working well so i am giving the 2 star for it.
