  <questionText>Jim used a solid and water to make Mixtures one (one spoon of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 3 (3 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 4 (4 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom), and 5 (5 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom) as shown below. He stirred each one and observed the results. Which solution(s) is saturated? What is the evidence of saturation?</questionText>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.140.1" accuracy="correct">Mixture 4 and 5 because it has the precipitate at the bottom of the cup.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.143.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 because you see material on bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.248.1" accuracy="incorrect">The ones that are saturated are mixtures 4, 5.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.255.1" accuracy="contradictory">Clear nothing on bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.285.1" accuracy="incorrect">It is chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.384.1" accuracy="correct">Solution 4 and solution 5. The cup has material on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.388.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 are saturated because there is material on the bottom that will not dissolve.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.389.1" accuracy="correct">Solution 4, 5. Saturation is when you can see some material on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.390.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 because there is material on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.394.1" accuracy="correct">Mixture 4 and mixture 5 are saturated. When water cannot hold any more of a solid, when you try to add more, it falls to the bottom. That happened in both mixture 4 and 5 so they are both saturated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.419.1" accuracy="incorrect">I forgot what that means.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.421.1" accuracy="correct">Mixture 4 and mixture 5. It is when particles is sitting at the bottom.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.429.1" accuracy="contradictory">Mixture one, 2, and 3 because they are clean on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.432.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 because there stuff on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.452.1" accuracy="correct">Mixture 4 and 5 because there is no more space to dissolve so it is saturated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.454.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 are saturated because there is solid on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.463.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 because he has clear water and material on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.467.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 because there is stuff at the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.468.1" accuracy="correct">Material 4, 5 has stuff on the bottom.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.473.1" accuracy="correct">Solution 4, 5 has some material.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.489.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 because they have material on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.492.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 are saturated because there stuff on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.494.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 are saturated because that is solid at the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.495.1" accuracy="correct">Mixture 4 and 5 because there is material at the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.497.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5 because there is a solid at the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.498.1" accuracy="correct">Cup 4 and 5 they are the material at the bottom so they are saturated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.501.1" accuracy="correct">Mixtures 4 and 5, the evidence is that there is material at the bottom and that means it is saturated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.502.1" accuracy="correct">4 and 5. Material on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.532.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think mixture 4 mixtures are.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.557.1" accuracy="correct">Mixture 4 and 5. The material at the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.562.1" accuracy="contradictory">Mixture one and 3 because they are both clear and have no particles on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.569.1" accuracy="correct">Solution 4 and 5 because there is material on the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.11b.602.1" accuracy="correct">Saturation means stuff at the bottom.</studentAnswer>
