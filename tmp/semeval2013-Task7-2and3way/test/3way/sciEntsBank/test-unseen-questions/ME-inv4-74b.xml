    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.192.1" accuracy="correct">It is able to drop them by shutting off the electricity traveling through it so the steel beams drop.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.206.1" accuracy="incorrect">By switching the magnet poles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.207.1" accuracy="incorrect">Not going to attach.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.208.1" accuracy="correct">Stopping the magnetic force.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.214.1" accuracy="correct">It is able to do that by cutting off the flow of electricity.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.215.1" accuracy="correct">By switching the magnet off.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.216.1" accuracy="incorrect">It is controlled with a control panel.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.224.1" accuracy="incorrect">It is able by because it is steel.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.225.1" accuracy="correct">The machine can drop its magnetic force.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.226.1" accuracy="incorrect">There is a person that pushes a button and it turns on and off.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.228.1" accuracy="correct">It is able to drop them by cutting the force between the magnet and the steel beam.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.247.1" accuracy="incorrect">They would use a controller so that they let them go and drop them.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.253.1" accuracy="incorrect">The man press this button to drop it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.74b.276.1" accuracy="incorrect">They will have to dump it, they do not have another way.</studentAnswer>
