    <studentAnswer id="SE.44.436.1" accuracy="incorrect">The advantage of having a heat sink in your house is that the heat slowly rises.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.44.443.1" accuracy="incorrect">The advantage of having a heat sink is that a heat sink absorbs more heat than a house without anything.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.44.489.1" accuracy="correct">One of the advantages of having a heat sink in the solar house was that it would absorb heat and release it slowly so the house would stay warm.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.44.494.1" accuracy="incorrect">The advantage of including a heat sink in a house would be that the house would probably stay warm.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.44.499.1" accuracy="incorrect">I used a black piece of paper and it was put on the bottom of the floor.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.44.503.1" accuracy="correct">As the house heats up so does the heat sink then at night fall the heat sink transfers heat into the air keeping it warmer than the others.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.44.504.1" accuracy="correct">When the water or masses of rock absorb heat they transfer it slowly enough that it keeps the room or area warmer.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.44.525.1" accuracy="incorrect">Not very good because a house gathers a lot of solar energy so it really does not need one.</studentAnswer>
