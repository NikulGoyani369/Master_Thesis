  <questionText>When Sarah did the chromatography test, she saw that one black ink stayed black and didn't separate. She discovered that she had used a permanent marker. She wondered what would happen if she used a different liquid. She wrote in her science notebook, What if I used vinegar in place of the water? Can I get the pigments in permanent ink to separate? How will Sarah know if vinegar separated the permanent ink?</questionText>
