    <studentAnswer id="LP.16d.108.1" accuracy="incorrect">A single fixed single movable has 2 more ropes than a single fixed. A single fixed system has one rope that separates the effort.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LP.16d.116.1" accuracy="incorrect">A single fixed does not change anything but a single fixed or single movable effort is 3 times the distance.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LP.16d.351.1" accuracy="incorrect">Another disadvantage would be that the system would be more time consuming.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LP.16d.595.1" accuracy="incorrect">The disadvantage would again be distance. On the single fixed, if you wanted to lift something 4 foot, you would have to lift it 4 foot. On a single fixed or single movable upward effort, you would have to lift it 12 foot.</studentAnswer>
