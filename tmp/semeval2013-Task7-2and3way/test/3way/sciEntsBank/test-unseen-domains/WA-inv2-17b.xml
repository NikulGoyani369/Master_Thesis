  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.174.1" accuracy="correct">When the water gets cold it contracts thereby lowering the water level in the straw.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.176.1" accuracy="contradictory">The water is expanding. The water molecules are getting colder so they all huddle up into a ball and go to the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.182.1" accuracy="correct">This happens because cold water is more dense than hot water or regular water so the water volume starts to go down or starts to contract.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.187.1" accuracy="contradictory">Because cold water has less density so it goes up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.189.1" accuracy="correct">Because cold water shrinks and is less dense so it goes down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.191.1" accuracy="incorrect">It happens because the water cools down so the water goes down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.195.1" accuracy="incorrect">The cold water pushes the water level down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.206.1" accuracy="correct">Since the water is cooled the water gets compacted causing the water level to contract.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.207.1" accuracy="correct">Cold water is denser so it goes down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.208.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it is getting cold inside but is going to go down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.209.1" accuracy="correct">When water is cooled the water level goes down because of the density. More dense.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.211.1" accuracy="correct">It happens because cold water contracts when it is cooled.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.222.1" accuracy="incorrect">Density.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.224.1" accuracy="incorrect">It goes down because cold water stuff goes down. And hot water does not go down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.225.1" accuracy="correct">Water is contracting.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.226.1" accuracy="correct">Because it contracts when it is cold.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.241.1" accuracy="correct">Because the water is denser so it forces it to contract.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.243.1" accuracy="incorrect">It happens by it being frozen.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.245.1" accuracy="correct">This happens because when water is cooled it contracts and gets less dense.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.246.1" accuracy="correct">Because the water contracts.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.17b.250.1" accuracy="correct">This happens because where water is cooled it contracts.</studentAnswer>
