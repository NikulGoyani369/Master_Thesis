    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.173.1" accuracy="contradictory">The block of wood is the same density of the water because the cube is kind of floating.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.174.1" accuracy="correct">The water is able to hold the block of wood up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.176.1" accuracy="incorrect">Well, saying less dense is like saying not as heavy. So the block of wood is probably soaked up water and is lighter.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.179.1" accuracy="contradictory">It is denser because it is more under water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.180.1" accuracy="contradictory">The block is floating and that means that it is denser than the water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.183.1" accuracy="correct">Because if it is less dense it would float.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.186.1" accuracy="correct">The block is floating so it is less dense.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.642.1" accuracy="correct">Because the block is floating.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.7b.647.1" accuracy="correct">The same because it is not sinking it is not way up on top of the water. Holy part is up and half is down.</studentAnswer>
