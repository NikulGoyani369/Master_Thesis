  <questionText>Alice planted one radish seed in each of 5 separate pots (Pot one, Pot 2, Pot 3, Pot 4 and Pot 5). She used the same amount and the same kind of soil in each pot. She put them by the same window. The first graph shows the amount of water she put into each pot every day (Pot one got 5 milliliters, Pot 2 got 10 milliliters, Pot 3 got 15 milliliters, Pot 4 got 20 milliliters, and Pot 5 got 25 milliliters). The second graph shows the length of each root after 7 days (0 centimeters for Pot one, 4 centimeters for Pot 2, 8 centimeters for Pot 3, 5 centimeters for Pot 4, and 0 centimeters for Pot 5). What is the range of tolerance for water for these radish seeds? Explain how you decided the range of tolerance.</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="EV_12b-a1">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters. The radishes did not grow at all in pots one and 5 so the range of tolerance is for pots 2, 3 and 4, which got 10 to 20 milliliters of water.</referenceAnswer>

  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.102.1" accuracy="contradictory">0 to 25 milliliters, 0 to 25 milliliters because the plants all grew from 0 to 25 milliliters of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.103.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters of water. Pot 2, 3, and 4 had been watered between 10 and 20 milliliters of water and they were the only ones that grew.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.105.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters water, I looked at which plant roots grew.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.109.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters of water, none grew in one or 5 so those do not count for range of tolerance.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.113.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, Well in pot one nothing grew same in pot 5 so the one that grew are a range of tolerance form 10 milliliters to 20 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.114.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, on chart 2 pot 2, 3, and 4 grew and one and 5 did not, on chart one pot 2 was given 10 milliliters, pot 3 15 milliliters, and pot 4 20 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.115.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, How I found the range of tolerance was I looked at which roots grew and found 10 to 20 only grew.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.120.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 milliliters of water, looking at the graphs.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.127.1" accuracy="contradictory">5, because some grew but not many so that is why I choose it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.128.1" accuracy="contradictory">5 to 25 milliliters, Because the chart says they only give them 5 milliliters to 25 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.132.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, Because 10 to 20 milliliters of water is when they started to grow and when the root stopped.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.138.1" accuracy="contradictory">25, I remembered the observations of Alice and put them in the questions to help me answer the questions.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.139.1" accuracy="incorrect">20 milliliters, Because the most water is 25 milliliters and in column 5 nothing grew. So I went to the next column which is 20 milliliters, and something grew.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.140.1" accuracy="incorrect">20 milliliters, The last number 4 and everyday she used 20 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.142.1" accuracy="contradictory">5, Because they can still live in that amount of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.143.1" accuracy="contradictory">25 milliliters, I looked at the graph.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.144.1" accuracy="incorrect">3, Because, it is the most and the highest one the for it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.148.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, I looked at the root length and only 3 had lengths. The lowest was low and the highest was 20.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.154.1" accuracy="contradictory">60 milliliters, How I decided I add up all the numbers of the graph.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.162.1" accuracy="contradictory">25 milliliters, The highest water bar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.164.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 milliliters, Because pot 3 grew the best with 15 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.171.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters In the second graph, pot 2, 3, and 4 actually grew. In the first graph, pot 2, 3, and 4 had water between 10 to 20 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.173.1" accuracy="incorrect">It should be 10 because it grew 9 inches and it had.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.188.1" accuracy="incorrect">10 milliliters, Because it starts growing at 10 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.190.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20, I decided those numbers because those are the ones that actually had roots and were growing.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.194.1" accuracy="contradictory">10 to 15, I decided because they almost look the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.196.1" accuracy="incorrect">3, because if there a good amount of water it will work.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.207.1" accuracy="contradictory">20, I subtracted the highest amount of water by the least and it seemed to be that much.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.209.1" accuracy="contradictory">25 water milliliters, the root of the graph 4 inches, 5 inches, 8 inches.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.219.1" accuracy="incorrect">The same, because they all sat next to the same window.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.381.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, Because I saw that 2 to 4 on the roots graph where the only one that grow. So 2 to 4 on the water graph have good amounts.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.382.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, Because if you put that amount plants will grow but if you put the other amounts you get no plants.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.386.1" accuracy="incorrect">3 centimeters, because it is the tallest root length and the plants will be taller.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.389.1" accuracy="contradictory">2 to 4 milliliters, Because on the chart 2 to 4 was the only one that barely grew.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.390.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters of water, pot 2 got 10 milliliters and grew roots and 15 milliliters for pot 3 and it grew roots and pot 4 had 20 milliliters and grew roots. The first pot did not have enough milliliters and the last one had too much milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.393.1" accuracy="incorrect">4, 4 because there is less seeds but it would grow more.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.397.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, because then plants only grew in 10, 15, and 20 milliliters and they were able to tolerate it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.398.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, because the second graph tells me the roots only grow in pots 2, 3, and 4. The water from pot 2, 3, and 4 is from 10 to 20 milliliters so I think it is the best range of tolerance.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.399.1" accuracy="contradictory">25 milliliters, Because 25 milliliters of water is too much water for radish seeds. The seeds could get soaked and die because of too much water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.401.1" accuracy="contradictory">6 centimeters to 22 centimeters, Because when she put 5 milliliters of water no plants grew. And when she put in 25 milliliters of water no plants grew. So it is no lower 5 milliliters and no higher than 25 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.403.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, Look at the amounts that made the plants grow.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.404.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, because on the graph it show that the root grew on 2, 3, and 4, So I look at how much water was given and wrote 10 milliliters to 20 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.406.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 milliliters, pot 3 had the longest roots then the others so I compared the 2 graphs and got 15 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.416.1" accuracy="contradictory">10 to 15 milliliters, That is the right amount because in the graph the second largest was watered with 10 milliliters of water and is not too much or too little.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.419.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 to 20 milliliters, I if you subtract 5 milliliters from 25 milliliters you get 20 milliliters and I get 15 milliliters as the optimum amount of water so I put 15 milliliters to 20 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.420.1" accuracy="contradictory">10 to 15, Well, if you go past 15 that will be too much and if you go below 10 that will be too little so it is just right. So it will be around 12, 13, 14, or 15.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.421.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20, I decided that because those are the numbers that had long roots.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.428.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, those were the plants with roots.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.429.1" accuracy="incorrect">20 milliliters, Range mean biggest number and lowest number subtracted by.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.430.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, Because those are the distances of which the plants grow in.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.431.1" accuracy="incorrect">20 milliliters, Because after 20 milliliters the seeds roots were 0 centimeters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.432.1" accuracy="contradictory">20 milliliters, To find the range you have got to take the lowest amount of water and subtract that from the highest amount of water. If the highest amount is 25 milliliters and the lowest is 5 milliliters you have got to do 25 minus 5 equals 20 milliliters. So 20 milliliters is the range.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.434.1" accuracy="incorrect">10 to 20 milliliters to 10 to 20 milliliters is the amount of water needed to help the radish seeds roots to grow.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.436.1" accuracy="contradictory">5, Because 5 milliliters makes the plant grow much bigger and faster.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.437.1" accuracy="contradictory">15, Because when I matched the charts, I found out that pot 2 had the longest roots for only 15 milliliters. Even though pot 5 had the most water some of it roots did not grow.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.438.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, because the plants that were inside that range all grew.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.439.1" accuracy="contradictory">5 to 25, The same way I decided the optimum amount.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.443.1" accuracy="contradictory">20 milliliters, I decided 20 milliliters because I took 75 milliliters subtract 5 milliliters in the first graph.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.446.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 milliliters, because the length of the root of pot 3 was he largest.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.449.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 milliliters, It grows the longest roots.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.454.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, The graph that has the root length has only numbers 2, 3, and 4 that have roots, comparing it to the first graph, I got 10 to 20 milliliters of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.461.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 to 20 milliliters, Once again I used the charts to get this answer.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.462.1" accuracy="incorrect">West one to 5, They have first and last one, they have most difference and I think the wet environment is the best, also the 15 milliliters water is the best.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.465.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 milliliters, I decide the third pot which had 15 milliliters of water because the root was 8 centimeters. The one which is the highest.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.468.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, because it grew in pots 2, 3, and 4 which had from 10 milliliters to 20 milliliters and they were the only pots that had growth.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.471.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, I compared the growth to the water from the charts given.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.472.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters, The range of tolerance is the range that the plant can grow and the plants grew with this amount of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.473.1" accuracy="incorrect">3 pots, Because it is the best one out of them all.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.486.1" accuracy="incorrect">3, because on the scale it was the third smallest and then grew the tallest.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.487.1" accuracy="contradictory">3, The 15 milliliters of water for the third pot is the highest.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.489.1" accuracy="incorrect">8, The range of tolerance was 9 because the radish plant grew big, 8 centimeters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.494.1" accuracy="incorrect">Pot 3, because do not need that much of water or need that little of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.496.1" accuracy="incorrect">I did not know so I just put 5.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.497.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 milliliters, I think it is 15 milliliters because the bar graph showed it was the highest.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.498.1" accuracy="incorrect">20, I looked at the graph.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.506.1" accuracy="incorrect">3, 3 because it took 3 days for it to grow 8 centimeters and 8 centimeters is the limit on the graph.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.510.1" accuracy="contradictory">50 milliliters, because that is how much we put in.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.523.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, from looking at the chart I saw that pot 2 and 4 was around 3.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.524.1" accuracy="contradictory">0 to 15, I looked at the chart and It said that pot 3 got 15 milliliters and on the bottom chart pot 3 grew the best.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.526.1" accuracy="contradictory">45 centimeters, I add up the root length and the water together and got 45 centimeters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.529.1" accuracy="incorrect">10 milliliters, I saw the plant that grew the least and checked the water amount.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.531.1" accuracy="contradictory">5 to 25 milliliters of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.532.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because in one pot did not grow and the fifth did not grow too that why I said no.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.536.1" accuracy="contradictory">5, I think the range is 5 because it is right in the middle of 4 and 6.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.538.1" accuracy="contradictory">15 to 20 milliliters, look at the graph.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.542.1" accuracy="incorrect">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters. Because pot 2, 3, and 4 have the longest roots and if you look at how much water they give it, it would be 10 milliliters to 20 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.545.1" accuracy="contradictory">33 milliliters, Because all together it is 33, 25 plus 8 equals 33.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.547.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters of water. On the root graph pot 2, 3 and 4 were the only ones that had root so I looked at the other graph and looked at the same pot number and then looked at the water amount.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.548.1" accuracy="contradictory">In the water, because the radish must be grown in 25 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.591.1" accuracy="contradictory">25 milliliters, It is the biggest amount of water the plants drink in the top graph.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.594.1" accuracy="correct">10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, I looked at which roots actually grew and then looked at how much water they got.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.600.1" accuracy="contradictory">Adding in 5, Because he is adding 5 because one pot is 5 pot 2 is 10 and on.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.601.1" accuracy="contradictory">5 milliliters, By looking at the graph it is going by 5 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.605.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters. Since pot 2, 3, and 4 grew roots, I assumed the amount of water in pot 2, 3 and 4 would be best.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.608.1" accuracy="correct">10 to 20 milliliters. Pots 2, 3, and 4 all grew and pot 2 had 10 milliliters and pot 4 had 20.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.626.1" accuracy="incorrect">20 milliliters, The least number that was used and subtract it with the highest number that was used.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.628.1" accuracy="contradictory">One to 07 milliliters, because you could kill your plant.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.12b.632.1" accuracy="contradictory">0 to 25 milliliters, because it was 0 all the way up to the number on the chart which was 25.</studentAnswer>
