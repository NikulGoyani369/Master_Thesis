  <questionText>The mangrove is a tree found only in saltwater environments. What would happen if you moved a mangrove tree to a freshwater environment? Explain your answer.</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="EV_25-a1">The mangrove tree would probably die or the tree would not grow well because the tree needs a saltwater environment. Water without salt is outside of the tree's range of tolerance for salt.</referenceAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.545.1" accuracy="incorrect">The mangrove tree will end up being dead because it is only saltwater tree.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.546.1" accuracy="incorrect">Well it would probably die because it would need some salt to live.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.547.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would not grow as well or it would not grow at all.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.614.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would not grow because it is used to saltwater and it would die.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.628.1" accuracy="incorrect">Maybe the environment might change by taking the tree because maybe a tree keeps the place cool if you take it out it will be hot.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.629.1" accuracy="correct">I think that it would die because the environment not in the tree's range of tolerance for salt.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.633.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would probably die because of all the different factors.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.634.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would not grow because if is used to saltwater. The change of environments makes a difference.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.635.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would not grow as good. Because if it is only found in saltwater environments I do not think it would grow as well.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.636.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would die because it is use to the saltwater.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.639.1" accuracy="incorrect">If you move in a saltwater tree to a freshwater environment it might die.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.640.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would die soon, because it only lives in saltwater.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.642.1" accuracy="incorrect">The tree would probably die because it would need the salt to survive.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.645.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think the mangrove tree would probably die. Because plants need their optimum environment to survive.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.646.1" accuracy="incorrect">The mangrove tree will die because it is in a freshwater environment not a saltwater environment.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.25.647.1" accuracy="incorrect">The mangrove would die because it is a tree only found in saltwater. So if you put the mangrove in freshwater, the mangrove would die.</studentAnswer>
