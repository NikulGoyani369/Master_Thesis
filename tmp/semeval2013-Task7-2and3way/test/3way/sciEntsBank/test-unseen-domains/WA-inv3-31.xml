  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.31.172.1" accuracy="correct">Their masses were different because the water on the sponge evaporated. If you leave water out for a certain period of time, it will evaporate.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.31.173.1" accuracy="correct">The mass was different because water evaporated from the sponge before they weighed it again so the weight changed.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.31.176.1" accuracy="correct">Well because the water probably evaporated 16 grams the day Maria weighed the sponge. When Jose weighed it, it was probably lighter.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.31.177.1" accuracy="correct">They were different because if you leave water out it will evaporate. Some of the water in the sponge evaporated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.31.179.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because water is really strong and it could make a sponge heavier but when it dried, water was not on the sponge no more so that made it weigh lower.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.31.181.1" accuracy="correct">They were different because all of the water in the sponge evaporated and water is heavy so it made the sponge heavy but when it evaporated it made the sponge weigh lighter.</studentAnswer>
