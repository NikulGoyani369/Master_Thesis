  <questionText>Grace set up a science experiment. Here's what she wrote in her notebook. First I put eggshells into a cup and covered them with vinegar. After a while, small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshells. The next day there were more bubbles. In a couple of days, the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear. I think I made a solution and a reaction. Explain why Grace thinks she made a reaction.</questionText>
