    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.387.1" accuracy="incorrect">Jorge knew a chemical reaction was occurred because it started bubble.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.390.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the mixture bubbled.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.396.1" accuracy="correct">Because gas being formed can be a sign of a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.400.1" accuracy="correct">Because he knew the bubbles meant carbon dioxide was being formed.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.419.1" accuracy="correct">Because the balloon expanded and filled with gas and it bubbled up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.421.1" accuracy="correct">Because it started to bubble or to fizz and it is the proof of gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.423.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because when it bubbles that means a reaction is taking place.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.425.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because bubbling is a sign of a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.429.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it bubbled.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.434.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the solution began to bubble.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.435.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because whenever it fizzes or bubbles that means it is a reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.436.1" accuracy="correct">Because the bubbles appear it makes a gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.453.1" accuracy="incorrect">He knew because there are bubbles in the container.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.458.1" accuracy="incorrect">Bubble.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.462.1" accuracy="correct">Because gas bubbles appeared.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.463.1" accuracy="correct">He knew because first he put a material in the water and started to bubble and that made gas so that is a clue of a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.466.1" accuracy="correct">Because there were gas bubbles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.468.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because he saw it bubble up that is why he knew it was a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.492.1" accuracy="incorrect">When he put the solid in the liquid it start to bubbles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.493.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it bubbled and fizz.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.498.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it bubbled and when something bubbled it means a reaction occurred.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.502.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the solution bubbled.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.532.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think it is because it started to bubble and because it would not do that if it was not a reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.541.1" accuracy="incorrect">He knew because it bubbled.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.543.1" accuracy="incorrect">Jorge knew a chemical reaction occurred, because the mixture began to bubble.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.568.1" accuracy="correct">He knew because a change occurred and it made a gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.575.1" accuracy="correct">He knew because when bubbles pop a gas is released into the air.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.576.1" accuracy="correct">Because it was making gas, it was fizzing, it made some precipitant.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.597.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the solution started to bubble.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.604.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the container started to bubble up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.605.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because he saw it fizz and bubble up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.611.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because bubble appeared when he add the solid material.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.612.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it bubbled and if it bubbles then it is a reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.633.1" accuracy="incorrect">A chemical reaction is when something happens if you add a material and a liquid together and something happens it is a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.638.1" accuracy="correct">Because it started to bubble and have a gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.10.644.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because his experiment took action right away with no waiting.</studentAnswer>
