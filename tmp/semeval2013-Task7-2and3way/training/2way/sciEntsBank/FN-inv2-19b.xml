    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.145.1" accuracy="correct">Susan will know which food contains the most sugar by how high the volume tube goes. Look at the one with the highest number or highest volume tube.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.152.1" accuracy="correct">If one puff up more that means that it has sugar in it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.176.1" accuracy="correct">She will know because the bag that was highest in the volume tube when pressing down has the most sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.181.1" accuracy="correct">The number that is higher when you put the bags in them push until pressure has more sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.188.1" accuracy="incorrect">By how much carbon dioxide. The fattest bag.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.219.1" accuracy="correct">When the volume tube shows that the food has more carbon dioxide in it, that means that food has the most sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.247.1" accuracy="correct">By the volume tube how much carbon dioxide. The more carbon dioxide the more sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.250.1" accuracy="correct">Susan will know how much sugar is in the foods by putting each bag in a volume tube one at a time. When her finder stops after pushing the top, the bottom of the part she pushes down will be on a number. That number is the milliliters of sugar in the food. Whichever number is the highest, that means that food has the most sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.253.1" accuracy="incorrect">Whichever bag has the highest recording has the most sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.292.1" accuracy="incorrect">She will know because one bag will be different.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.293.1" accuracy="incorrect">If how much carbon dioxide there is in the volume tube.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.294.1" accuracy="correct">The food with most carbon dioxide has the most sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.299.1" accuracy="correct">Susan will know which food contains the most sugar seeing which one has the most carbon dioxide.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.326.1" accuracy="correct">The bag with the most carbon dioxide has the most sugar in it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.330.1" accuracy="correct">The food that has the most, carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide has the most sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.408.1" accuracy="correct">When the timer stop for 10 minutes put the baggie into the volume tube to see which food had the most sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.421.1" accuracy="correct">She will know which one has the most sugar by measuring the volume and if the food has a lot of sugar. You will see it because it will have a lot of carbon dioxide in the bag.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.426.1" accuracy="correct">She will know how much sugar does one have by looking at the bags. If one has a lot of air then that one produces more sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.427.1" accuracy="incorrect">The yeast will react and the bag is going to fill up with and measure it with air and measure it with a volume measure.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.430.1" accuracy="correct">The one that has the most sugar is inflated and fat.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.438.1" accuracy="incorrect">I will have big grease stain.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.439.1" accuracy="correct">The more sugar the more carbon dioxide and the more carbon dioxide the bigger the volume.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.448.1" accuracy="incorrect">Maybe by using the value shared.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.468.1" accuracy="correct">Compare the bags and see which one has the most gas in the bag. The one that has the most has the most carbohydrates or sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.481.1" accuracy="correct">The more air in the bag, the more sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.486.1" accuracy="correct">Compare the bags to see which bag has more carbon dioxide in it 50, the more carbon dioxide in the bag the more sugar the food has.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.495.1" accuracy="correct">She would know by the volume tube.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.498.1" accuracy="correct">The more carbon dioxide the more sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="FN.19b.545.1" accuracy="correct">Whichever one has the most carbon dioxide in the baggy has the most carbohydrates.</studentAnswer>
