  <questionText>Nigel made solutions in the bottles as shown below. Solution A was 2 spoons solute in 50 milliliters water and was clear with no material on the bottom. Solution B was 4 spoons solute in 100 milliliters water and was clear with no material on the bottom. Nigel took 50 milliliters of solution from bottle A and put it in cup A and 50 milliliters of solution from bottle B and put it into cup B. He put the cups on each side of the balance. Which picture shows what would happen? A is heavier than B, B is heavier than A, (A and B are the same weight). Explain your choice.</questionText>

    <referenceAnswer id="MX_46b-a1">The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.</referenceAnswer>

  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.386.1" accuracy="incorrect">B has more solute than A does therefore B will weigh more since the solute is equally spread.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.391.1" accuracy="incorrect">They are the same amount of water different in spoons. That is why B weighs more because of spoons.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.425.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because you would have to take 50 milliliters of water out of cup B or else cup B would be heavier. So it would more fair.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.429.1" accuracy="incorrect">I chose cup A because it seems more concentrated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.437.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because he pour only 50 milliliters of solution in each cup.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.439.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because B is the double of A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.457.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because cup B has more spoons of the solute and has more water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.464.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because if you just took 50 milliliters of water out of each, they would be equal. I got this one wrong.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.466.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think the second one because B has more scoops of solute.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.467.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because now there is now only some of water in each and 4 is more than 2 and cup B more concentration.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.471.1" accuracy="incorrect">I picked cup B because I thought it would have more spoons of solute than cup A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.472.1" accuracy="correct">I pick this one because if you split solution B into 2 water levels it will be 50 so if A is 50 and 2 spoons the other one is going to have to have 2 spoons too because the other one is double.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.488.1" accuracy="correct">Because 2 is half of 4 spoons and 50 milliliters is half of 100.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.493.1" accuracy="correct">Because Nigel took out the same amount of solutions. There is 2 spoons for 50 milliliters of water. The concentration are the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.495.1" accuracy="correct">They both have 2 spoonfuls per 50 milliliters so when you compare 50 milliliters from each they both have 2 spoonfuls in the 50 milliliters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.499.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because they both have the same amount of water but have different amount of salt.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.502.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think cup B would be more heavy because cup B is more concentrated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.524.1" accuracy="incorrect">They are going to be even.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.528.1" accuracy="incorrect">Cup B is more concentrated than cup A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.540.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because solution B has more water in the top.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.542.1" accuracy="correct">Because if he takes 50 milliliters out of A and puts it back in A it is still the same and if he takes 50 milliliters out of B and puts it back in then they are still both the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.559.1" accuracy="correct">They are the same, because there is a pattern, for every 2 spoons of solute add 50 milliliters of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.561.1" accuracy="incorrect">B because it gave 100 milliliters water and 4 spoons of solute. And A gave 5 milliliters water 2 spoon of salt so I stay with B.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.563.1" accuracy="correct">I chose the same because he took bottle A and half of bottle B and half of bottle B equals A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.570.1" accuracy="incorrect">It is like x like 50 times 2 equals 100 so then 2 spoons of solute equals 50.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.575.1" accuracy="incorrect">All solutions are mixtures, and a solution is when something disappears into the other.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.595.1" accuracy="incorrect">Solution would need to be doubled.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.597.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because he took the same amount from each bottle.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.598.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because they both have the same amount of solution in each cup. So both cups weigh the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.605.1" accuracy="correct">Because there is 2 spoons and 50 milliliters and then there is 4 spoons and 100 milliliters so they are going to weigh the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.608.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because there is more water and solute.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.612.1" accuracy="incorrect">I chose that one because in bottle B they took 50 milliliters but in it they put 4 spoons.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.630.1" accuracy="incorrect">I chose this one because in the picture above there is more water in cup B.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.640.1" accuracy="incorrect">Solution B has more water so it weighs more than solution A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.643.1" accuracy="incorrect">Cup B because it is just double.</studentAnswer>
