  <questionText>Mariella made a saturated solution by adding a solid to 100 milliliters water. Richard made a saturated solution by adding the same solid to 250 milliliters water. Do the 2 saturated solutions have the same concentration? Explain your answer.</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="MX_16a-a1">Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.</referenceAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.140.1" accuracy="incorrect">No because one has more water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.206.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because they do not say how much spoons are in there and 250 milliliters is more concentrated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.243.1" accuracy="incorrect">No. Because one has more water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.277.1" accuracy="incorrect">No because it has to be equal.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.291.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because one has more water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.366.1" accuracy="incorrect">No they do not because they are not the same amount of water and it will not equal the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.381.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, because if you get the same amount of water from each then weighed it they would measure up to the same amount.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.386.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because there is less room for the solute to spread out in Mariella's solution. The material at the bottom is not part of the solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.389.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes because they both have the same amount of solid.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.390.1" accuracy="incorrect">No because they have the same solid but different amounts of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.394.1" accuracy="correct">Yes, the solutions have the same concentration because, using the same solute and water, there is a saturation point per milliliters of water and they have both reached the saturation point, they are saturated and cannot become any more concentrated, so they are both equally concentrated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.416.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, they do not because Richard put more water which will make it less concentrated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.437.1" accuracy="incorrect">No. I think that Mariella's saturated solution is more concentrated because it has more solid.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.453.1" accuracy="incorrect">No because one has more water which will make the solution heavier than the other.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.463.1" accuracy="correct">Yes because if they are saturated, then the stuff on bottom went to waste and the waters are holding the same number of water and solid except for the stuff on the bottom. Take that stuff out then they both have the same concentration.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.464.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because the 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because it has less solvent and 250 milliliters of water has more solvent.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.466.1" accuracy="incorrect">No because if you had Kool-aid the one with more water will give the powder more space to dissolve, but the one with less water will saturate because there is less space for the powder to dissolve.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.488.1" accuracy="correct">Yes because they both cannot hold any more solid.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.494.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes. They are both saturated which means they are also concentrated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.528.1" accuracy="incorrect">No. Why because one has 3 spoons of salt in it and 2 has 4 spoons of salt in it that is why it is more solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.557.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because it might be a different amount of the solid in it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.564.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think yes because it does not matter how much whatever you put in it and they put the same amount of stuff.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.566.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, because if you take out the same amount of water out of each solution and put them on a balance then they will weigh the same. Only a certain amount of water can hold a certain amount of salt.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.572.1" accuracy="incorrect">No it does not because the 250 is more than 100.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.573.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes because if you take out a certain amount of water out of each of them and weigh them and they will weigh the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.576.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, the one with 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because the solid has less room.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.584.1" accuracy="incorrect">No because Richard has more water than Mariella and Mariella only has 100 milliliters of water. And it is more crowded with 100 milliliters of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.592.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because Richard has more concentration space than Mariella because he has more water which means less saturation room.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.597.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, because they are both saturated and if they add more it will just become more saturated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.598.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes. Because they both put sort of the same amount of water into the cup and so they both have the same concentration.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.601.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because Mariella's solution had more water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.606.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes there is the same amount of solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.611.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, because if they did then both the water would be the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.16a.644.1" accuracy="incorrect">No because Richard has way more solution than Mariella so it is not the same amount.</studentAnswer>
