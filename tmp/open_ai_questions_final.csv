question|ref_ans|student_ans|accuracy|explainationWhat role does the path play in determining whether or not a switch affects a bulb?|If a bulb and a switch are in the same path the switch affects the bulb|if the switch is contained in the path with the bulb, the switch affects the bulb.|correct|: Path continues from the source to a point P. There is also a path which goes through target and at some stage in its pathway it encounters an obstacle S (either switch depicted in figure). As long as no obstacles are inside any segment of this last contiguous free-space conduit whose beginning or end is outside containment sphere
What does a voltage reading of 0 tell you about the connection between a bulb terminal and a battery terminal?|the terminals are connected|there is no difference in electrical states|incorrect|: the two wires connect to each other; even if we do not read a voltage, there is always some electrically connected between leads. This can be verified by touching metal connectors together and one senses an electrical sensation upon completion of connection. Furthermore, using jumper cables from 'connector P3' on board 5 would
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 6 and the positive terminal.|Terminal 6 and the positive terminal are connected|there is no gap between the positive battery terminal and terminal 6|correct|: Terminal 6 is ground (-)
Why do you think those terminals and the negative battery terminal are in the same state?|Terminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected to the negative battery terminal|because neither of them are recieving current|correct|: Pairs 1 and 2 are connected to each other through Terminals 4 & 5. Therefor there is no gap between them, therefore they share the same polarity. Only Terminal 3 has an electrical gap from any of these terminals because it always recieves current directly form one terminal at a time rather then sharing that
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4.|Terminals 1 and 4 are connected|terminal 1 is connected to terminal 4|correct|: The terminals are connected.
Why was bulb C off when switch Z was open?|Bulb C was no longer in a closed path with the battery|bulb c was contained in an open path with the battery|correct|: students must realize that since the light bulb was contained in an open circuit, with no complete or closed paths containing it, then its filament cannot emit any electrons. This is why the light was out when switch Z is opened
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and terminal 6.|Terminals 1 and 6 are separated by the gap|there is a gap between terminal 1 and terminal 6|correct|: the low voltage helps prove that
Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.|Measuring voltage indicates the place where the electrical state changes due to a damaged bulb.|because if there is a difference in electrial states then there is a gap. That will located the burned out bulb|correct|: Power is measured in volts.If the power supply is connected to an electrical state that does not change voltage then something has caused a break or gap somewhere between where it connects and leads into the bulb.The exact location of this junction can be determined by measuring different voltages on either side,when you locate one with
Why was bulb A on when switch Y was open and switch Z was closed?|Bulb A is still contained in a closed path with the battery.|there was a closed path not effected by the switch|incorrect|: Z closes the path from P through A, so what's controlled are all lights between B & C.
When switch X was closed and switch Y was open, why was bulb A on?|Bulb A was still contained in the same closed path with the battery.|because bulb a was still in a closed path with the battery|correct|: By asking this question, we can assess whether the student knows what a closed path is. A quick look at figure 1 suggests that an acceptable answer could be "bulb X," because switches B and C are both open, so bulb Y must have been on before switch D was opened! The use of a check
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.|Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap|positive battery terminal is separated by a gap from terminal 1|correct|: The terminals are indicated correctly, however if you just looked only at the drawing of terminal 1 would not be able to see that there is a positive battery terminal because it appears that they both have negative markings. 5.) Students took apart hard drive
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 2.|Terminals 1 and 2 are connected|terminal 1 is connected to terminal 2|correct|:Under what circumstances will a switch affect a bulb?|When the switch and the bulb are contained in the same path|if the switch and bulb are contained in the same path, the switch will affect the bulb.|correct|: For whatever reason you apparently added a lamp to this question and we need not be concerned about that (at least I am hopeful). What matters is which devices share the same path. When they do, only one of those will respond when enabled or disabled with regard to its neighbor sharing another direct exit from within but no
Why does an open switch impact a circuit?|the open switch creates a gap|it causes an open circuit|incorrect|: as stated in the image above, if a switch is open it will create an OPEN CIRCUIT. As Ohm's Law states resistance equals constant times Voltage over Current this means that for all things equal which should be true other than no flow of current through and out around (open circuit) there would cause
When switch X was open and switch Y was closed, why were bulbs B and C on?|Bulb B and Bulb C were still contained in the same closed path with the battery.|because bulb b and c were still in a closed path with the battery|correct|: Here we could ask about multiple switches and how they interconnect to form a closed path for electrical flow, but let's instead lead the question back toward circuits with one switch. The image below might help (source Wikipedia)
What does a voltage reading of 1.5 tell you about the connection between a bulb terminal and a battery terminal?|the terminals are not connected|the termials are the oppsite|incorrect|: Sorry, that's just not possible . If the terminals are unconnected then you will get no if any voltage into the resistance to check it. There should be some very small reading of something like 0 volts due to internal battery potential difference between multiple cells caused by cell engineering process which is impossible for students or anyone but
Explain why circuit 5 is a short circuit.|the battery is contained in a path in which there is no bulb|the battery is contained in a closed path without any devices|correct|: see figure B. It's clearly a short circuit since the outer loop represents an equal path for both sides of battery b1 Reference: The MIT Licence terms * See answer explanation
Why does a damaged bulb impact a circuit?|a damaged bulb creates a gap|a damaged bulb causes a gap at the blub|correct|: Failure of a bulb or component interrupts the circuit. Without proper contact, current will not flow through the closed switch contacts and power to lights is cut off.
What are the conditions that are required to make a bulb light up?|there is a closed path containing both the bulb and a battery|a complete circuit of electricty|correct|: No conditions are needed for this; it is self-explanatory ( by the definition of a complete
Explain why circuit 4 is not a short circuit.|Circuit 4 has no closed paths|the battery is not contained in a closed path|correct|: A short circuit is a connection between two points in a conductive path. There is no closed
What do you think the red X means?|the battery is damaged|a short circuit|correct|: The Anode (positive terminal) is missing Under what circumstances will a damaged/ burned out bulb affect another bulb?|If they are in the same path the burned out bulb affects the other bulb.|if the damaged bulb and the other bulb are contained within the same path|correct|: The destroyed bulb is in the circuit and therefore one less element supplying positive current to its lightbulb. Since all of these elements are contained within different paths, if their bulbs burn out simultaneously they will not be affected by each other's "blown" or lit-up state for example: Path 1 with Bulbs
Why do both bulbs A and B stay on when bulb C is burned out?|If C burns out then A and B are still in a closed path with the battery|because bulb a and b are still contained within a closed path with the battery|correct|: Bulbs A and B are NOT in a closed path until you pull out the power source-the battery pack. C doesn't last forever but I think your question is implying that just because it goes first this means that without its light bulb life or not, Project will work with/without closing circuit between bulbs at
Explain why circuit 2 is not a short circuit.|The battery in 2 is not in a closed path|because the two ends of the battery do not connect to one another|incorrect|: This is why it doesn't matter what node we choose as a source because the two ends of the battery do not connect to each other. In this case there can be no current at all or infinite observed value depending on your sense connections, but interpretation which you need help with math insturctor
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.|Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap|because they are connected to opposite terminals|correct|: Always test the terminal you expect to be positive with neg1 and if it reads differently than tell your teacher.
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 3 and the positive terminal.|Terminal 3 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap|positive battery terminal is separated by a gap from terminal 3|correct|: Voltage between point A and arm has to be less than the value of voltage across this section. AB is a 'parallel' circuit so VAB3 = 1.5V hence VA must be <1 - possible only if terminal 3 gives 0 ohms resistance..thus requiring no current it touches battery positive directly
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 6 and the positive terminal.|Terminal 6 and the positive terminal are connected|Terminal 6 is connected to the positive battery terminal|correct|: No, terminal 6 is not connected to the positive battery terminal. See below diagram:
What is voltage?|Voltage is the difference in electrical states between two terminals|is the difference between two terminals|incorrect|: Measure of the force per unit charged observed in an electrical agent Examples: Volts = 120V, 9.9 V, AA cells can supply __ volts
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 5 and the positive terminal.|Terminal 5 and the positive terminal are connected|terminal 5 is connected ot the positive battery terminal|correct|: To measure the resistance of a device that uses no moving parts, such as a battery or resistor, you can place it in series with one side of an AA size dry cell and the other side to be measured. Connect terminals 1 (+) and 4 (-). Measure voltage across 2 (mm/ddV), noting
what does it mean when the voltage reading jumps from 0 to 1.5?|the bulb is damaged|that the bulb between those terminals is damaged|correct|: When the leads are moved closer to another bulb terminal, more current is drawn; this causes a drop in voltage across that damaged bulb. From our experience with these electronic circuits (get ready... undergraduates always discover something like electricity), it's safe to assume there won't be any reading at all if you move the
Describe the paths in this diagram and explain how those paths account for the results.|Bulb A is in a path which does not contain B and C, so bulbs B and C don't affect it. Bulbs B and C are in the same path. They affect each other, but Bulb A doesn't affect them.|there is one path though bulb a and a second path through bulb b and c. The two paths are independent from one another. If one bulb goes out in one of the path it only affect the bulbs within that same path|correct|: The probability of the bulb going out is independent from other bulbs. If one goes bad, and I replace it because it's dark in that part of my house: firstly, given two locations within a circuit which should be good to solder correctly but were installed wrongly only installing each location will not by itself solve anything
Why didn^t bulbs A and C go out after bulb B burned out?|Bulbs A and C are still contained in closed paths with the battery|because bulb a and c were still contained within a closed path with the battery|correct|: No longer contained within a closed path with the battery.
Elena has a male lizard that has lived for several years in the habitat she provided. She knows that some lizards are territorial. Besides additional food and water, what should she be sure to include in the habitat before she adds another male lizard?|Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.|Elena should add shelter.|correct|: The goal is to make the males as comfortable as possible and show her good husbandry. She also needs to take precautions because adding age-similar mates can result in fighting even among those lizards that would normally be okay with each other; for example, if they were not raised together. It sounds like she has
Janet found the solubility of silver chloride to be 86 grams in 50 milliliters of water. Mike found the solubility of silver nitrate to be 108 grams in 50 milliliters of water. Janet and Mike thought they must have made a mistake. They thought the solubilities of all materials in water should be the same. Is it possible that both solubilities are correct? Explain your answer.|Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.|No because no solid that one has more than the other in the same amount of water.|incorrect|: It might be possible that Mike measured the temperature of his solution when it was not at full room temperature. We all know solubility is much lower when materials are in supercooled water or hot solutions.
Diva's father told her she should not eat so many cookies because they were pure sugar. Diva decided to investigate the amount of sugar in Fruity Cream cookies. She performed the sugar test on 4 grams of pure sugar and on 4 grams of Fruity Cream cookies. The results are pictured at the right. Why did Diva need to test pure sugar?|Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.|Diva needed to test pure sugar so that she could make sure Fruity Cream cookies did not have as much carbon dioxide as pure sugar to see if her dad was wrong.|correct|: One test will show whether Fruity Cream has as much carbon dioxide (or doesn't) as pure sugar.
The drawing above shows a plaza in the afternoon. Label the west side of the drawing with a W. Label the north side of the drawing with an N. How did you know which direction was west?|In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.|You would know by which way the shadow is pointing to.|incorrect|: East SaintLouis:)
Diva's father told her she should not eat so many cookies because they were pure sugar. Diva decided to investigate the amount of sugar in Fruity Cream cookies. She performed the sugar test on 4 grams of pure sugar and on 4 grams of Fruity Cream cookies. The results are pictured at the right. Are Fruity Cream cookies pure sugar? What is your evidence?|No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.|No, because with pure sugar is higher than 200 milliliters and Fruity Cream cookies is 150 milliliters.|correct|: These are straightforward questions that require students to explain their reasoning. Their explanations can be embedded in any science curriculum across all content areas, enabling each classroom teacher access to the student dialogue through electronic dashboards representing class blogs or even individual discussions .
Grace set up a science experiment. Here's what she wrote in her notebook. First I put eggshells into a cup and covered them with vinegar. After a while, small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshells. The next day there were more bubbles. In a couple of days, the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear. I think I made a solution and a reaction. Explain why Grace thinks she made a reaction.|A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.|Because after a while small bubbles appeared, but in the next day, bubbles, starting to be more eggshells were disappeared.|correct|: A reaction involves a chemical change that gives off heat, sound or light. 12 student answers 2. Answer Question: Choong studied some seaweeds in his study of marine biology on Australia's Great Barrier Reef This is one type maybe red algae it has the properties characteristic which are no vascular tissue xylem and ph
Julie and David each built a solar water heater. Both solar water heaters were 10 centimeters x 10 centimeters x 30 centimeters. Both water heaters were painted black on the inside bottom and filled to the top with 3 liters of room temperature water. Both water heaters were set in the sun. They checked the temperatures every 5 minutes and made the table below. Which box did Julie build, A or B? What evidence supports your answer?|A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.|A. Because it is larger. B is very skinny.|correct|: Student's answer is best supported by comparing the large increase in water temperature over a short time frame for heater A with smaller increases of an equal amount, but distributed across longer periods. For example, B shows increased rises at t=10 & t=20 minutes which are ignored when considering only one 5 minute interval difference
Pam and her family were planning a hike. Pam found 2 maps of the same area. Her friend recommended she use the topographic map when they went to the lake. Which letter (Q, R, or S) on the map is on the steepest part of the trail? (Q) How do you know it is the steepest part of the trail?|The contour lines are closest together at Q.|As the contour lines get closer the mountain side gets steeper.|incorrect|: Where the contour lines are close together, this indicates that there is a steep slope or cliff.
Jack made a lifeboat out of a large paper cup. He decided to measure how far the boat sank when different numbers of marbles were added. His data are shown in the table. Identify the standard for Jack's experiment.|The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.|A 2 boat.|incorrect|: We were supposed to choose the row that has no marbles in it.
Describe how you can tell the difference between the crystals from the calcite test and salt crystals when you observe them in an evaporation dish.|The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).|It if looks like salt then the salt is salt crystals. If it has lines in them it is calcite crystals.|incorrect|: The Student's response addresses the significance of different area shapes. Target Area for this Question: Nomenclature, description, identification
What is your "rule" for deciding if the part of a plant you are observing is a fruit?|If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.|It has to have at least one seed.|correct|: The use of the word "rule" in questions tends to make students answer with a formula. In this case, two fruits are also still parts of plants (seeds need roots and leaves in order to grow). Students must instead rely on general principles for classifying the target concept– fruit is part that contains
What process forms deltas? A. Gravity B. Erosion (C. Deposition) D. Decomposition.  Explain how deltas form.|Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).|Like a small river getting big, deltas are formed when a regular river is out to a ocean or lake. Over time the water will erode the mouth into a fan shaped deposit.|incorrect| : Earth materials are transported or moved when water moves in a moving current. Since an ocean is much larger than any river, over time the smaller deposits of sand and dirt at the mouth mountain will gradually grow because more earth material can be deposited there to form bigger landforms that rise out from where they were formed underwater .
Grace set up a science experiment. Here's what she wrote in her notebook. First I put eggshells into a cup and covered them with vinegar. After a while, small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshells. The next day there were more bubbles. In a couple of days, the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear. I think I made a solution and a reaction. Explain why Grace thinks she made a solution.|A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.|Because first she put eggshells then the next day she made a solution.|incorrect|Hide
Below are pictures of wind instruments. You blow air through them to produce sounds. Why does [the saxophone] make the lowest sounds?|The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.|Because it is a horn that make like the mm.|incorrect|: The student constructs the analogy that to make low sounds you need a longer tube. Note how in order for this connection between part of speech (instrument) and phoneme(sound) is also productive; "I can tell when speakers are speaking into horns." ; She doesn't say, only saxophones because
Mary told her friend Sharice that she had a rug to sell. Sharice asked if the rug would fit perfectly, wall to wall, in her bedroom. Mary went home and measured the rug. She put her feet heel-to-toe and counted the number of shoe lengths it took to measure the rug. She found the rug was 18 shoes long and 12 shoes wide. Sharice did the same thing in her room to measure the space for the rug. Her floor was 18 shoes long and 12 shoes wide. A perfect fit! Sharice bought the rug and took it home. To her dismay, she found it was too short and too narrow for her bedroom! What could Mary and Sharice do to better measure the size of the rug?|Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.|The rug was 12.|incorrect|: Ballroom dancers use the term "shoe" to mean any dress/dance shoe. A standard ball room dance floor is 91 inches long and 30 1⁄2 feet wide, which are 18 shoes by 12 shoes respectively. At home one can likewise divide a space with heel-to-toe steps for
Look at the picture of the circuit to the right. What will happen to the motor if the light bulb burns out?|The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.|The motor will still run.|incorrect|: The pathway for current to flow is always there so the motor will continue to run regardless of what happens with light bulb.
Katie got a guitar for her birthday. She experimented with the strings and found she could change their sounds. One way Katie could change the sound of a string was to tighten it. Describe how the sound was different when the string was tightened.|When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.|If you get it right it will not have much Frequency.|incorrect|: This answer suggests that the pitch is related to changes in frequency. The fact that frequencies are lower when tighter does not confirm or refute this student's utterance, but might be misleading at least initially with some students looking only at graph A (the one most people would quickly recognize as an oscilloscope). Because "higher
Andi and Scott decided to investigate solar water heaters using collectors of different colors (but the same size) as one variable and covered versus uncovered as a second variable. Look at the graph of their data and answer the questions below. What does the graph tell you about the effect of using blue versus red collectors?|Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.|Blue is very attracted to the heat whether it is covered or not. Red is not attracted.|correct|: In the uncovered filled, no type of solar water heat collector heats up any better than another. Uncovering a blue one drastically increases how fast it creates hot water compared to other colors and all their controls at first then switches over and looks like the…
2 groups used marbles to weigh the same apple. Jin's group found the apple weighed 35 marbles and Bee's group found the same apple weighed 60 marbles. Both groups used the correct procedure. What should the groups do to make their results more useful?|Use a standard unit of mass like grams.|They could use grams to weigh them.|correct|: They could convert 35 or 60 marbles to grams Answer: 4. Question:
Betty was puzzled. In the morning the shadow of the bus sign is in the street. In the afternoon the shadow of the bus sign points the opposite direction. Explain to Betty why this happens.|In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.|I think that Betty was a best shadow that was facing the opposite direction.|incorrect|Guidance: At times, an explanation/theory is also acceptable. Such as above)
Beth made 2 solutions of different concentrations of water and citric acid. She put 50 milliliters of the first solution in cup X and 50 milliliters of the second solution in cup Y. When she put the cups on the balance, the balance looked as shown below. Which solution, X or Y, is more concentrated? Explain how you know which is more concentrated.|X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.|Y, y because it have to be less.|incorrect|: The more concentrated a solution is, the greater its total mass.
Look at the circuit in the picture. The gap between the D-cell and the switch needs to be connected. Can you use a piece of string to make the connection? Why or why not?|No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.|No because a string is not made of iron or steel.|incorrect|: The conducting pathway must be just iron or steel, which are good conductors.
A solution is a type of mixture. What makes it different from other mixtures?|A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.|You can see through it.|incorrect|: If you can see through a mixture, it is called solutions. Example: salt water Example: sugar solution
Andi and Scott decided to investigate solar water heaters using collectors of different colors (but the same size) as one variable and covered versus uncovered as a second variable. Look at the graph of their data and answer the questions below. Why would comparing only the red uncovered heater with the blue covered heater not provide useful information?|When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.|More than one manipulated variable.|correct|: Measured Variables: The independent variable was color, which is red for uncovered and blue for covered. The dependent variables were the temperatures of water 6 hours after sunrise, 6 & 12 inches above collector level. There are 4 data points (triangles) but in reality there should be an infinite number - because one
Katie got a guitar for her birthday. She experimented with the strings and found she could change their sounds. Katie also discovered that when she pressed down on a string with her finger, making the string shorter, the sound again changed. Describe how the sound was different when the string was shortened.|When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.|It will not make loud pluck like the other strings.|incorrect|: The tighter the string, the higher sound you hear from it. Still image Play animated waveform
Andi and Scott decided to investigate solar water heaters using collectors of different colors (but the same size) as one variable and covered versus uncovered as a second variable. Look at the graph of their data and answer the questions below. What does the graph tell you about the effect of using a cover?|Water heats up faster when covered.|The blue covered was very hot.|correct|: The blue line shows the highest temperature. If it is covered, then there are less ways for heat to escape so water heats up faster.
Anne is investigating which objects stick to magnets. She recorded this in her notebook. I was surprised! A nail was stuck to the magnet. When I accidentally touched the nail to a paperclip, the paperclip stuck to the nail. If Anne touched the nail to a brass ring, what do you think would happen and why?|The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.|I think it would stick for a little bit depending on how long you hold the magnet to the nail because the nail becomes a temporary magnet.|incorrect| of Answer : The object that was "stuck to the magnet" is describing a type of force.  
The sand and flour in the gray material from mock rocks is separated by mixing with water and allowing the mixture to settle. Explain why the sand and flour separate.|The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.|One is heavier than another see it settles in how many layers there is ingredients.|correct|: Information gained through the separation process is used to support this answer.
2 groups used marbles to weigh the same apple. Jin's group found the apple weighed 35 marbles and Bee's group found the same apple weighed 60 marbles. Both groups used the correct procedure. Since they weighed the same apple, what do you think happened to make the results different?|The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.|They use different sizes of marbles.|incorrect|:   Mass of 3.5cm diameter hard hikacala marble-35g; mass is almost solid, rought feeling with no hollow space within the marbles' spheres
Amber predicted that a black covered box would heat up faster than a white covered box. She took 2 identical shoe boxes and wrapped one with white paper and the other with black paper. She punched a hole in each box, stuck a thermometer into each hole, and put both boxes in the sun. Every 5 minutes, Amber recorded the temperature in each box. Will the data support Amber's prediction? Explain your answer.|Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.|Yes. The black box will get hotter than the white because the black box can hold more heat.|incorrect|: Student - This is very good data, however punctuation can be corrected to be accurate. For example the first entry of 4:15 has no comma between minutes and 5 . She had repeated one of her initial observations (black at 13... white at 8).
When Sarah did the chromatography test, she saw that one black ink stayed black and didn't separate. She discovered that she had used a permanent marker. She wondered what would happen if she used a different liquid. She wrote in her science notebook, What if I used vinegar in place of the water? Can I get the pigments in permanent ink to separate? How will Sarah know if vinegar separated the permanent ink?|Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.|By doing the steps that I told her.|incorrect|: Because vinegar is an acid, it would have changed the ph of the mixture so that separation occurred.
Look at the circuit in the picture. The gap between the D-cell and the switch needs to be connected. Can you use a piece of aluminum foil to make the connection? Why or why not?|Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.|Yes because a piece of foil is not steel.|correct|: Some materials, called insulators , do not conduct electricity. These are good for using as the filler in electrical circuits. Good examples of insulators include plastic or rubber because they should be able to stand up to exposure to moisture and other conditions related contact with circuitry without damage.
Jen was talking on the phone with her Uncle Bill who lives in Canada. When she asked him how the weather was, he said it was nice and warm, about 28 degrees. What unit is Uncle Bill using to report the temperature?|Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.|The temperature.|incorrect|: Canadian schoolchildren meeting many guidelines learn to report the weather temperatures in Celsius, because that will help them talk about speech effectively with Canadians later.
Lee has an object he wants to test to see if it is an insulator or a conductor. He is going to use the circuit you see in the picture. Explain how he can use the circuit to test the object.|Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.|He could not because the 2 wires need to be touching.|incorrect| : The free wire needs to touch the other two wires for electricity to flow through. So Lee can place one end of his object on a metal ring that makes contact with both loose ends, then take the second end and put that into water seeing if it creates bubbles when he flushes because the positive charge created by screw
Cory and Rachael set up 3 solar water heaters to see which would show the greatest water temperature change. The containers are shown below. Each is the same height (4 centimeters), and the same width (10 centimeters). Only the lengths are different; Container A is 10 centimeters, Container B is 30 centimeters, and Container C is 40 centimeters. They painted the plastic containers black, filled each with the same amount of water, and put a clear plastic lid on each one. Then they set them out in the sunshine. Here are the data that Cory and Rachael collected: After 10 minutes Container A was 3 degrees Celsius, Container B was 9 degrees Celsius, and Container C was 12 degrees Celsius. Use the graph paper on the next page to graph the temperature change for each container. If Cory and Rachael had a container that was the same height and width as the other containers, but 20 centimeters long, what do you think the temperature change would be after 10 minutes? (6 Celsius) How did you decide what the temperature change would be for the new container?|20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.|Because there is a 10 centimeters on the graph and put 10 centimeters with one and it will change because it is bigger and more space to store more heat.|incorrect|: This is the correct way to set this up. First determine how big each container is, and which one comes closest in size between 10 centimeters and 30 centimeters. Now represent that range as a rectangle on your graph paper with side-lengths of "[Container Size] -10" (to indicate smaller than) ,
Jim used a solid and water to make Mixtures one (one spoon of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 3 (3 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 4 (4 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom), and 5 (5 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom) as shown below. He stirred each one and observed the results. Describe how Jim could separate the dissolved solid from the water in Mixture one. What happens to the solid and to the water?|Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).|He could use a paper filter decided what he is using or a screen.|incorrect|: Evaporation is a substance changing its physical state from liquid to gas (evaporating) and the process of taking liquids and boiling them off until they turn into gases. Crystallization: The formation, during cooling or spontaneous separation processes such as precipitation, freezing/melting-point depression which creates solid particles
Carrie wanted to find out which was harder, a penny or a nickel, so she did a scratch test. How would this tell her which is harder?|The harder coin will scratch the other.|You could tell if it has the hardest if most of it came off.|incorrect|: This answer is written form and the student was connecting to what they were just learning, but had a hard time with the concept of one penny scratched another rather than two pennies.
Look at the illustration of the pulley system at the right to answer the questions. What additional disadvantages might there be to this system compared to a single fixed pulley system?|You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.|It is harder to use this system than to use a single fixed pulley system.|incorrect|: This means it is easier with the single fixed pulley because you don't have as much work to do.  You can figure out an advantage of 5, four advantages for one system and two advantages joined together by 2 links does not equal 1 so there would be no amount smaller than x=2 which gives a
Denise made a circuit to light a bulb or run a motor off a D-cell battery. She used a special switch. Below is the schematic diagram of her circuit. The switch is inside the dotted box. Why will the bulb light when she moves the switch to the left?|There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.|It will happen because that is turning the switch off or opening the switch.|incorrect|: Normally the switch is a closed circuit to allow flow of electricne . When Denise turns it left-and makes a complete break in her battery's contact, he will only have an indirect light bulb, which won't work.
Georgia found one brown mineral and one black mineral. How can she test them for hardness using only the 2 minerals (no tools)?|Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.|She can do a scratch test and see which one is harder.|incorrect|: The minerals could be hard or soft, you can't tell by their color.
Emily put 20 milliliters of a mystery solution in an evaporation dish. When all the water was gone, she drew the picture of the dish you see here.  Using the crystal-shape key below, what chemical do you think was dissolved in the solution? A. Epsom salt B. Sodium thiosulfate (C. Alum) D. None of the above. Explain why you chose that answer.|Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.|Because it look a lot like alum.|incorrect|Delivered: Emily demonstrated an interesting bit of crystallization by identifying which crystal shape they changed to after removing water (known as the solid). Commend her for identifying this process and rank it using expertise instruction.
Denise made a circuit to light a bulb or run a motor. She used a special switch. Below is the schematic diagram of her circuit. The switch is inside the dotted box. What will happen when she moves the switch to the right?|The motor will run.|The light bulb will work.|incorrect|: The electricity in the circuit led by Denise will flow into jump across R5, to finish at C. If she makes a broken path , no current can flow through resistor or capacitor . With motor inside the dotted box unable help us since it need continuous sourse of power :(
A harp has strings of different lengths. Describe how the sound of a short string being plucked (pulled and let go quickly) is different from the sound of a long string being plucked.|If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.|The small string has the highest pitch than the long one.|correct|: The pitches depend on how tightly the string is stretched. A shorter stretch means higher pitch; a longer stretch means lower pitch.
Why does the tree shown in the picture have a shadow?|The tree blocks the light from the Sun.|If it show on south east the shadow will be facing north east.|incorrect|: It is early evening, the tree might have cast a shadow or it was facing east.
Mary was trying to understand how tuning forks make sounds. She hit the tuning fork on the table and placed the tuning fork into a cup full of water while it was still ringing. The water splashed in all directions. How did seeing what happened help Mary understand how a tuning fork makes sounds?|The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.|Because if you bang it on the wood it starts to make a weird sound! But if you put it in water, you can see that it is moving because the water goes swash so you can see it move.|incorrect|: To get children to understand that sounds come from vibrations, you need students' of the same proficiency level and success chemistry with Physical Science or Chemistry classes. Teachers of another class can rotate in after a quick description what is going on: vibrations, like when you hit two glasses together (tremors) and "b
Lee has an object he wants to test to see if it is an insulator or a conductor. He is going to use the circuit you see in the picture. How will he know if the object is a conductor?|If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.|The motor will run that is how you will know.|correct|/Guideance to the perceived answer Jim used a solid and water to make Mixtures one (one spoon of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 3 (3 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 4 (4 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom), and 5 (5 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom) as shown below. He stirred each one and observed the results. If Jim made Mixture 2 with 2 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters of water, what would he observe? What evidence do you have to support this?|Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.|There would be a clear liquid with no solid on the bottom.|incorrect|: Student answer is correct. A clear solution formed when 3 spoons of solid were placed in water, so there will be no visible solids after 2 sopes dissolve Denise made a circuit to light a bulb or run a motor. She used a special switch. Below is the schematic diagram of her circuit. The switch is inside the dotted box.
What will happen when she moves the switch to the left?|The bulb will light.|The light bulb will not work.|incorrect|/ResponseShe closes the circuit so not current can flow.
Georgia found one brown mineral and one black mineral. How will she know which one is harder?|The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.|Because whichever one scratches is the hardest.|correct|: If you use a harder material in one experiment it is called destructive testing.
Describe what the graph tells you about the relationship between the number of scoops of fertilizer and the mass of beans harvested?|When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.|When it get up to 3 scoops the mass of beans harvested decreases.|correct|: Each tomato plant is missing two of its arms. What would be the appropriate graph?
Joanne mixed material R and material D together, added water, and stirred. After a few minutes, the liquid was clear and there was a solid on the bottom of the cup. Joanne used a paper filter to separate the solid from the liquid. Why does the solid stay in the filter when the liquid goes through?|The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.|The solid was too big to go through the filter paper.|correct|: Filter tion happens because the liquid was filtered through a paper filter after it had been allowed to completely mix and then left for many minutes. The solid that you might not think would give is actually giving off its particles into the water, making something called an emulsion . Emulsions can be clarified by using filt
Sometimes a red stoplight changes to green only when a car stops at the light. A type of magnet hidden under the surface of the road triggers the light to turn green. What is it about the car that could trigger a magnet to send a signal to the light?|A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.|The car is made of iron or steel.|correct|: Even though automobiles are made of steel for the body, tires are usually filled with compressed air. Air has no influence on magnetic fields at all! Unless you know that cars have iron magnets to attract computer chips inside, many students might forget about this detail and fail here after giving an answer above.
What happens to earth materials during deposition?|Earth materials settle out during deposition.|Earth material get deposited and forms a delta.|correct|: Results are seen in the debris. But they also will find some amount of deposition with this question, because it is talking about material settling out which means its accumulating over time e.g ocean sediments Look at the schematic diagram. What will happen to the other 2 bulbs if the middle bulb burns out?|If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.|The other 2 will still light.|correct|: Two 2-bulb configurations are drawn on the right side. Keep in mind that bulbs A and Z (the DC light source) could be an old fashioned Christmas tree lights or whatever you wish them to represent; there simply needs to be a distinction between singular bulb, half of voltage divider configuration, quarter of A magnet attracted another magnet even when a foam block was placed between them (see box A below). What do you think would happen if 2 foam blocks were placed between the 2 magnets (see box B). A. The magnets will stick. B. The magnets will not stick. (C. It might stick, but it might not.) Explain why you chose that answer.|You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.|I chose because that is the answer.|incorrect|Example-Teacher: When the teacher provides an example to illustrate her thinking, she helps students understand what is important in answering this question.
What is the relationship between the amount of effort required to lift the load and its distance from the fulcrum?|If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.|They both relate because one equals the other for a answer.|incorrect|:Jim used a solid and water to make Mixtures one (one spoon of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 3 (3 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 4 (4 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom), and 5 (5 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom) as shown below. He stirred each one and observed the results. Is the concentration of Mixture 5 less than, greater than, or the same as the concentration of Mixture 4? Explain your answer.|The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.|Greater than because mixture 5 has the same amount of water with more spoons of solid.|incorrect|: Notice that student answer reflects an incorrect belief. Many students use the existence of undissolved material to demonstrate inadequacy of mixing when in fact, if there is no change in appearance at all then they are adequate mixtures - both Mixture 1 and 4 were successful even though some solid was still present on the bottom Denise made a circuit to light a bulb or run a motor off a D-cell battery. She used a special switch. Below is the schematic diagram of her circuit. The switch is inside the dotted box. Why will the motor run when she moves the switch to the right?|There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.|It will work because that is closing the switch.|correct|: "Closing the switch" refers to making a connection between two components. If Denise moves her switch so that it completes contact with another part of circuit, then ... A solution of water and material A is clear. A solution of water and material B is also clear. When the 2 solutions are mixed, a white solid settles to the bottom, leaving a clear liquid.
What does the white solid indicate?|A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]|It dissolved in the water.|incorrect|: The Materials were compatible, suggesting they have the same composition. 2 clear solutions mixed to give a white substance indicates chemical reaction occurred between them.(The question was answered based on its sense and not what material A is.)
The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.|The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.|The motors will not run because it goes from the positive side to the positive side it has to go from positive to negative to work.|correct|: The terminals on the battery must be aligned opposite to one another in order for them to transfer electricity.
3 girls wanted to see who could throw a ball the farthest. Each girl brought her favorite ball to the park. Ling brought her basketball, Diana brought her football, and Rachael brought her baseball. They made a line on the playground. They all had to throw the ball from that line. Ling took 2 steps up to the line and threw her basketball. Diana stood at the line and threw her football. Rachael got a running start and threw her baseball when she reached the line. Rachael threw her ball the farthest. Describe what the girls need to do to make the contest a controlled experiment (fair test).|All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.|They need to have the same ball and throw the ball at the same place.|correct|: All variables etc. - must be the same
3 girls wanted to see who could throw a ball the farthest. Each girl brought her favorite ball to the park. Ling brought her basketball, Diana brought her football, and Rachael brought her baseball. They made a line on the playground. They all had to throw the ball from that line. Ling took 2 steps up to the line and threw her basketball. Diana stood at the line and threw her football. Rachael got a running start and threw her baseball when she reached the line. Rachael threw her ball the farthest. Describe 2 variables that are not controlled in the contest.|Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.|No one had the same ball and threw the ball differently.|correct|: The girls have both the girl and ball being a variable. This is what distinguishes their distances thrown from each other's distance measured since they are not controlled variables, this leads to difference in results that compare different launch techniques applied by them while throwing different balls at varying angles which will inevitably bring about an inconsistency across all of
When Amy added water to a mixture of baking soda and citric acid, the mixture began fizzing. Amy concluded there was a chemical reaction because it fizzed. Why is fizzing evidence of a chemical reaction?|The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.|Because when it fizzing it releases a gas. When a gas forms from 2 materials it is a gas.|incorrect|: I talk about that gas is not formed. So it suggests like happening like when you eat the sour candy . When mixing vinegar and baking soda, water (which has citric acid in small amounts) "poisons" the carbon dioxide molecules produced by hydrochloric acid because hydrogen ions displace them from solution
Denise made a circuit to light a bulb or run a motor. She used a special switch. Below is the schematic diagram of her circuit. The switch is inside the dotted box. Can she run both the light and the motor at the same time? Why or why not?|No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.|Yes because there is enough power for it to work but it will be bright and it is a parallel circuit.|incorrect|: There is only one battery, so the power has to go through either circuit or maybe both but there will never be enough energy for them to complete at the same time. If Denise was really good with physics she would just use two separate batteries instead of using electromagnetic induction
How can you use a magnet to find out if the key is iron or aluminum?|If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.|If it is iron it will stick if it is aluminum it will not stick.|correct|: When a magnet is close to iron, the magnetic fields from both will interact and due to that interaction force exists between them. The net result of these forces produced by two magnets interacts with each other which produces an attractive or repulsive effect depending on how it's positioned in accordance with pole orientation . But if we check
Salt crystals form when the water evaporates from saltwater. Describe the salt crystals.|The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.|The were like feathers they were tiny little overlapping squares.|correct| of Analysis: The student is correct that the resulted form of this experiment was cubic, but he failed to compare them to the target. He also does not describe his reasoning for why they are squares with X's on top instead making a more general statement about feathers which did not capture all alternatives since some of these might have
Susan has samples of 5 different foods. Using only the results of her experiment, how will Susan know which food contains the most sugar?|Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.|Putting the bag of yeast, warm whatever the food sample you are tasting.|incorrect|: The sugar samples will ferment the yeast and it will produce a certain amount of gas.
Look at the diagram of a circuit at the right. Will the motor run? Why?|The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.|I chose it because all the wires have to be hooked together to make a circuit.|correct|/Question: Look at the diagram of a light bulb circuit. Will the lamp turn on? Why or why not
Only one circuit below will light the bulb. Which one will work? Why is that the only circuit that will work?|That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.|It is the only circuit that will work because the metal is touching the bottom and the wire is touching the bottom of the light.|correct|: If the metal was touching both sides of the light, then it would complete a circuit through that loop. The wire is directly touching one side of this bulb so there are no other possible completed circuits if connected to two points on either piece. There may be many options for ones where only 1 contact point has been made
Ms. Teridann, a geologist, made a chart showing the scratch-test data for 3 minerals (Mineral X, Mineral Y, and Mineral Z). She wrote "yes" if the tool scratched the mineral and wrote "no" if it did not scratch it. Topaz is a mineral that cannot be scratched by a fingernail, a penny, or a paperclip. How hard is topaz compared to minerals X, Y, and Z? Explain how you know.|Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.|Topaz is harder because it would be all no on the chart.|incorrect|: This answer states that topaz is the hardest of the 4 minerals listed because none of the tools could scratch it. Lithium Topaz can be scratched by a fingernail or a penny, but only with great difficulty and effort (equal to scratching quartz). The nail might not reach gemmy crystals in some examples
Look at the schematic diagram including a D-cell battery and 3 bulbs. Why do the other 2 bulbs stay lit if the middle bulb burns out?|The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.|It will happen because it is a parallel circuit not a series.|correct|: By parallel circuit, I'm referring to the diagram below. Each path between light bulbs 1 and 3 is independent of each other; whereas by series connected together they all share one common pathway to pursue current (like resisters create Ohm's Law because there are many loops).
3 girls wanted to see who could throw a ball the farthest. Each girl brought her favorite ball to the park. Ling brought her basketball, Diana brought her football, and Rachael brought her baseball. They made a line on the playground. They all had to throw the ball from that line. Ling took 2 steps up to the line and threw her basketball. Diana stood at the line and threw her football. Rachael got a running start and threw her baseball when she reached the line. Rachael threw her ball the farthest. What variable did the girls control in the contest?|The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.|Where she threw the ball.|correct|: All of the girls threw from a controlled position, so their launch angles and velocity were not affected by other forces.
Jim used a solid and water to make Mixture one (one spoon of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), Mixture 3 (3 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), Mixture 4 (4 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom), and Mixture 5 (5 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom) as shown below. He stirred each one and observed the results. What evidence does Jim have that the solid and water make a solution?|The mixtures are all clear.|Because when you use a mixture and as it dissolve it is a solution.|correct|: This target answer is incorrect. All Mixture 1 Milliliters looked clear, with nothing on the bottom; however, they didn't dissolve to make a solution yet because when mixtures are solid in an insolid state but without suspended particles dissolved vs everything dissolves.(Saladin pg 291) (3-5
Use the "slope" and "no slope" stream-table maps and logs on the facing page to answer these questions. What information do you get from the stream-table logs that you do not get from the stream-table maps?|You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.|The minutes and seconds of when the events happened.|incorrect|: The time it takes for the materials to travel gives an idea of how fast water travels through a formation. If flow rates are anything but instantaneous, then this motion tends to take longer and typically will bring up more oil (or move bed waters faster along flowlines) than using something like "total porosity."
Why was the siren's sound designed to have this property?|So that people notice the sound.|Because so it can tell people to get out of the way in case of a fire.|correct|: – The siren is designed to have a high‐low frequency sound. It does not happen that the low part of the sound will go through any rough objects, because it still has enough volume/power to warn people from being burned down in their homes or workplace. But this question can also be used as an
One function of the bess beetle's elytra (the hard, black wing set) is protection. What is another function of the elytra?|The elytra are used to make sounds.|To make sound.|correct| : The elytra are used to make sounds during courtship, which is known as stridulation. Each wing of the beetle has ridges that can be moved up and down against each other into three sections that look sorta like teeth on a comb when looked at from underneath (the side away if you want
Look at the picture on the right. Label the poles on each magnet. (The bottom 2 magnets are stuck together, the others are not.) What is the rule that explains why you labeled the poles the way you did?|Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.|Because they are repelling each other always.|incorrect| : We are using the terms "Like poles repel" and no reference to opposite. The last one was tricky, I would explain that they were stuck together because of surface attracting them not true opposite attraction - directly mentioning with our concept opposed force answer #5 without stating opposites
What is a heat sink?|A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.|The cement is heat sink and the wood is heat sink.|incorrect|: Some materials stores heat energy in manageable volumes. Heat sinks are used during phase changes where a lot of internal energy is produced but cannot escape from the system to environment without assistance (PV = nRT). Typically this resource will be lost, unless it can be practically removed because that would violate our 1st Law requirement
If Phil, a geologist, wants to test for calcite while in the field, what should he bring with him? (an acid such as vinegar). Describe what Phil should do to test for calcite and what he would observe.|Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.|He should put a rock and vinegar into a vial and if the rock has calcite, the water will turn murky.|incorrect|: If the acid response is what Phil sees, he could tell there was calcium within it. With vinegar, if Phil sees fizzing bubbles this would be a good indication that his rock has calcite in them because of pH levels dropping; then carbonates release CO2 into solution (Dictionary).
Paula wants to test a food to see if it contains acid and/or sugar. When Paula added water and yeast to a sample of the food and put the mixture in a warm water bath, the mixture began to fizz and bubble. Paula tested for the other substance. What would the test results tell her?|If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.|Not much sugar is in the thing she is testing.|incorrect|: If sugar is present, yeast cannot consume it. So when Paula tested for gas production, she got no results (the test was negative).
Paula wants to test a food to see if it contains acid and/or sugar. When Paula added water and yeast to a sample of the food and put the mixture in a warm water bath, the mixture began to fizz and bubble. What does this chemical reaction indicate?|The food contains sugar.|Carbon Dioxide carbon dioxide.|incorrect| : When an acid is dissolved in water it forms a solution that can conduct electricity. That's because carbon dioxide, which bubbles when the yeast was added to the food sample with HCl and sugar (which decomposes into glucose and other substances), reacts with hydroxide ions ("OH−") — one of three species
The inside of a pea seed is shown below. Describe the function of each of the parts: cotyledon.|The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.|Feeds baby plant, embryo.|incorrect|: It is a seed leaf.
When conducting a controlled experiment, why do you use a standard?|A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.|You have a standard because if you do not it will not be controlled.|incorrect|: The standard is the control variable in this experiment. Without a "standard" (or some way to compare your results with), you could not possibly determine how differing levels of sunlight impacted plant growth; eventually, over time and many experiments, it might be determined that plants need full sun for plenty of water-use efficiency
How do you know when a solid and a liquid form a solution?|The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.|Because it turns clear. It bubbles.|incorrect|: You can see that something is dissolved in water or clear soda when you stir it with a spoon, but I want the students to label this activity as "dissolving" so they need t o pick one of these two markers. First let's find at least 30 seconds for their reactions...
Design a way to use carbon printing to find out if 2 Labrador retrievers have the same paw patterns. How will you know if the 2 dogs have paw patterns that are the same?|Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.|I will use carbon printing to know.|incorrect|: I will take 2 old newspapers, 1 with each dog's paws print on it. Then lay the two dogs prints side by side and compare them
How does the water flow in a creek during a flood compared to normal water flow?|During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.|It depends on if it has a slope or no slope.|incorrect|: The water flows stronger. If the slope is bigger then there will be more dirt in creek bed and it increases how much soil gets washed away by rivers during eroded flood flow events .
Mariella made a saturated solution by adding a solid to 100 milliliters water. Richard made a saturated solution by adding the same solid to 250 milliliters water. Do the 2 saturated solutions have the same concentration? Explain your answer.|Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.|No because one has more water.|incorrect|: Adding more solute does not change the concentration of a solution.
Nathaniel and Sammy are trying to make up a code for sending messages to each other by dropping items in a drop chamber and listening to them. Sammy wants to design a code using blocks made of plastic, metal, and wood. Nathaniel thinks it would be a better idea to use wooden blocks of different sizes and shapes. Which student's method would make it easier to tell the difference between the sounds? Why?|Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.|Nathaniel - Because a wooden blocks, because if you drop 3 thing you can not hear all 3. But if you drop one thing you can hear better.|incorrect|: Sound travels through all of these materials at different speeds. You can acoustically tell the difference between plastic, wood and metal just by looking–plastic is smoother than either one of them so its not as difficult to release air quickly. But dropping 3 blocks will sound more like a deep "thump" or
Look at the picture below [which shows a balance tipped down on the side containing a ball; the right cup has 20 grams and 10 grams mass pieces]. The mass of the ball is one of the following. It must be A. 20 grams. B. 30 grams. (C. 40 grams.) Explain why you chose the answer that you did.|There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.|He can use is volume because he can use it.|incorrect|: If the ball in cup A weighed over 30 grams it would be suspended vertically in that weighing.
The inside of a pea seed is shown below. Describe the function of each of the parts: embryo.|The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.|The baby plant.|correct|: Inside this little bag of water are three tiny leaves, a tiny shoot system with roots close to the top.
How do you define a controlled experiment?|An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.|A controlled experiment is an experiment where you only change one variable.|correct|: If the students changes all variables at once, one or multiple of them might be affected by a hidden variable. For example if a boy and girl were asked to sniff different essential oils for their effect on romantic feelings , they would presumably not tell us which oil smells better as that could have been influenced by gender . You
Look at the 2 solar water heaters shown here. The black triangular area is the solar collector in each container. If both heaters contain the same amount of water, would you expect the temperature change in heater X to be greater than, less than, or the same as the temperature change in heater Y after 30 minutes? (Same) Explain your answer.|The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.|Takes the same amount of space.|incorrect|: The black areas are both equal, so equal amounts of heat is being absorbed. Energy received = energy after - subtract KE on X product KE on Hot Water
Sue bought a white wading pool for her grandchildren. She wanted to heat up the water as fast as possible. She thought that if she put plastic sheeting in the bottom of the pool it might heat up the water faster. She had a sheet of yellow plastic and a sheet of dark green plastic. What should Sue do to heat the water as fast as possible? A. Put the yellow sheeting on the bottom of the pool. (B. Put the dark green sheeting on the bottom of the pool.) C. Put no sheeting on the bottom of the pool; leave it white. Explain why you chose that answer.|Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.|Why I chose the dark green sheeting was because the darker color absorbs heat.|correct|Question: Sue wants to make an emergency shade in case she is out walking on her lunch hour. She has some dark green plastic sheeting and fastens it between trees with straps like these (Figure 1). What kind of shadow will the combination cast when viewed from directly above? A.(Show student figure that lies flat
Look at the picture of the bean seedling shortly after germination. Describe the function of each of the parts: seed coat.|The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.|To protect the baby seed.|correct|: "If the seed coat is open, seeds store in moisture during over winter. If all its cells are living they release water when need ed by germinating plants." 
Why does a rubber band make a sound when you pluck it (pull and let go quickly)?|The rubber band vibrates.|Because it is sticky!|incorrect|: Falling objects have potential energy because of their position (height) and motion (acceleration). Once the rubber band is released, there's no force pulling it down. It moves as a wave. The higher parts move away from those lower-part waves meeting behind them to form an alternating pattern called nodes and ant
Explain in one sentence what each graph tells you. Graph A) number of tree rings versus time.|As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.|This graph tells me this tree has a lot of rings.|incorrect|: Graph A shows that as time goes on rings are formed. This person is correct because the first few years have no tree rings but towards year ten there are many of them, after fifteen they become regular and more consistent until forty-five where it seems to alternate with every successive number of odd numbers being one ring less
Look at the rubbings of 2 different fabrics. What do the rubbings tell us about the different textures of these 2 fabrics?|Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.|They are different. Like bark not bark.|incorrect|: By looking at the type of boxes used, you can deduct that A must be finer than B.
Trace over the complete circuit with your pencil to show where it is. Even though there is a complete circuit, the bulb will not light. Why not?|The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.|It will not get light because the negative is getting to the motor.|incorrect|: A circuit has a closed loop so the current can go around and complete one whole path before going back to its starting point. 
Jorge added solid material to a container of clear colorless liquid. The mixture began to bubble. Explain why Jorge knew a chemical reaction occurred.|Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.|Jorge knew a chemical reaction was occurred because it started bubble.|incorrect|: When two solutions are mixed together, mixing will not necessarily cause a chemical reaction. Some reactions quickly occur because the substances already contain molecules that react to form new compounds (sometimes leading to bubbling). But for other linear equations
Bryan taped a golf tee to a globe of the Earth. He shined a flashlight on the globe. The best way for Bryan to demonstrate how shadows change during the day would be to: (rotate the globe.) move the flashlight. Why would this best demonstrate how shadows change during the day?|Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.|It would best show it because the earth always rotates around the sun.|incorrect|: Shadows change during the day because we are rotating on our axis and orbiting the sun.
Why is it important to use a standard unit when making a measurement?|So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.|You might get more medicine than you needed.|correct|: Standardized units often include the type of sample, for example about how big it is (e.g., gee-grams), who made it (for example, by me) and where you got your information from if that seems important to consider. We should use this same convention whenever we talk or write
Look at the finger patterns below, then answer the questions. What is different about the finger patterns?|The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.|One has it one way and the other one the different way.|incorrect|: Learning to look for differences between finger patterns is important in order not mistake one print pattern for another, say Prints 52 & 53. Although beginning the loop at different sides of a hub are both executed on-the-run, they will be distinct prints when on evidence charts provided by investigators after sufficiently correct fingerprint comparisons
Kate said: "An object has to move to produce sound." Do you agree with her? Why or why not?|Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.|Yes, Because if things do not move it will not make a sound. Like if you are talking your voice box has to move.|incorrect|: In Kate's explanation, she states that the air surrounding a vibrating object has to have something to move it. When an object is making sound waves , those vibrations are causing particles in their environment (the atmosphere)to stir around and a molecule need only undergo a phase shift or displacement of one unit for theref
The change in elevation between contour line A and contour line B is 20 meters. What is the change in elevation between contour line A and contour line C? How do you know that is the change in elevation between A and C?|40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.|40, Because between each is 20 and if you times 20 twice you will get 40.|correct|:same convention whenever we talk or
Look at the picture of the bean seedling shortly after germination. Describe the function of each of the parts: cotyledon.|The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.|Helps give the plant food.|incorrect|: The first leaves produced after germination function as food factories. Also, the cotyledon supplies nutrients necessary to support early growth of a root and shoot system until photosynthesis can begin producing sugars strong enough for continued energy production by both leaf and storage organ production from meristematic cells rather than differentiated tissues
Explain in one sentence what each graph tells you. Graph B) speed of light versus time.|As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).|This graph tells me that the speed never changes.|correct|: The times at which Path B reaches a given point all occur at the same time. Since they are identical points, it is also true that velocity remains constant while starting from rest and continuing to 60 km/hour without acceleration or gravity
You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you know the crystals were salt?|The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.|We used magnifying glasses and some sort of guide thing that told us what different kinds of salt looks like.|incorrect|: We used the methods to separate and identify unknown substances that I learned about in chemistry.
Gerry used a paper filter to separate a mixture of sand, salt, and water. Think about particle size and answer this question: Why did the salt go through the filter while the sand got caught?|The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.|Because the salt was too small so small that you cannot see it.|correct|: Smaller particles can move through smaller openings. Holes in filter paper are small enough to trap large sand grains but allow salt particles, which were too small for the holes, to drip or wash away with water after they dried on cake-like blotting papers left overnight under a fume hood .
Draw an arrow to show which direction the water flows in the river. (Rose Mountain is on the left and Happy Valley is on the right in the drawing.) Why do you think the water flows in that direction?|Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).|The river dries as it gets to the mountains.|incorrect|: When water is flowing towards a low area (valley) it will always flow downhill to help the process of "lowest area".
You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you separate the salt from the water?|The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.|By letting it sit in a dish for a day.|incorrect|: In order to get a concentrated mixture of salt and water, you can make ice cubes with fifty percent more sodium chloride added. Another way is during the second word problem when she had coffee moisture on her cheek for thirty-six hours straight .
You can tell if a rock contains calcite by putting it into a cold acid (like vinegar). Describe what you would observe if you did the acid test on a rock that contains this substance.|Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.|You would see if it bubbles.|incorrect|: The dissolution of calcite generates tiny gases (HCO 3 − ) that bubbles to the surface.
Anna wants to compare the fat in walnuts and peanuts. Using only the results from her experiment, how will Anna know which one, walnuts or peanuts, has more fat? The experiment has the following procedure: Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts (for example, one gram). Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait (the same time for each).|Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.|Using only the results from her experiment, Anna will know which one has more fat in it by the larger the grease spot the more fat.|correct|: Choice 2 is the correct answer. Anna collected pieces of brown paper or something similar, laid out to make a flat surface large enough to contain her peanut and walnut samples equally. She then should have flattened each sample onto one area for all question in this lab so there are no areas that would favor either kind of
Adam's friend gave him a cup filled with a water solution. Adam did not know what solid material was used to make it. He evaporated the solution and found crystals in the dish after all of the water was gone. How will the crystals help him decide what solid material was used to make the solution?|Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.|He could see what solid used and he will find out what it is.|incorrect|: (Student) has an additional, but redundant alternative for the material consideration: crystal shapes. Each character in Adam'sFriendGaveADisk tag sequence is unnecessary and was missed by several students. Moreover, specifying what his friend gave him--a "cup filled with a water solution" rather than just "the contents
Wendy is making an electromagnet. She wrapped a long, insulated wire around an iron nail. What should Wendy do next to complete the electromagnet?|Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.|She would put and back it to a D-cell.|correct|: If the nail is placed near to iron objects, they are attracted by this magnet.
Don wants to make a map of his neighborhood that fits into his notebook. He has a photograph of the neighborhood but it is too large. Complete the description of how Don can draw an accurate map that fits into his notebook: 1. Put an overlay grid over the model. 2. ____ 3. Draw a smaller grid with the same number of squares in your notebook. 4. ____ 5. Create a key to go with the map.|2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.|2. Trace the model onto the overlay grid. 4. And copy the overlay grid onto the smaller grid that is in your notebook.|correct|: I expect students to be able to follow a procedure or sequence of steps even if the teacher only explicitly writes one step. Writing ModelImagery correctly is harder than it appears because you will get ridges in your paper when marked up through two layers (1) drawing grid over image, and (2) pen
Describe the relationship between the length of the string and the number of swings a swinger makes in 15 seconds.|The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.|The longer the swinger the less swings it makes.|correct| : Observation shows that one shorter string makes far more swings than the longer piece of ribbon, wooden rod or even rope after 15 seconds. Question : Is 20% greater than 16?
Jana and Emily used indophenol to test 3 beverages for vitamin C. The number of drops they added to make a 10 milliliters sample of the blue indophenol indicator become colorless are given here: 8 drops of Overly Orange 13 drops of Luscious Lemon 33 drops of Fruitsnap (and it still didn't change color). Why didn't the indophenol change color with Fruitsnap?|Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.|The indophenol did not change color with Fruitsnap because it did not have any vitamin C in it.|correct|: The graph shows that little or no vitamin C drops the level at which this solution turns yellow. We know from experience, if it dropped below 0 ng/g would make no color change to purple-orange by itself showing how much essential nutrient is in our foods and drinks each time we eat them!
Anna wants to compare the fat in walnuts and peanuts, but she isn't sure how. Write a procedure Anna can use to compare the fat in walnuts and peanuts.|Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.|Anna can do weigh it but she will need walnuts and peanuts. And after she weighs them wait for 2 days and the check back and will know how much more fat is in them.|incorrect|: To compare the fat in walnuts and peanuts, Anna would wait until each sample had made contact with its environment for 24 hours. Then using a hammer, she could measure out equal sizes of samples from both paper towels (since their different densities will accommodate wet weights). Getting her class to devise ways that do not
When a seed germinates, why does the root grow first?|The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.|Because it sucks up the water as food for the plant and stem.|correct|: Though this reflects basic understanding (that plants need water), humorously expressed, it is not correct. The germinating seed puts out unequal amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide at different times in its development; these molecules are used up by the surrounding air or soil to create an imbalance which triggers neighboring coleoptiles
The graph shows temperature data from 2 containers. One container had 100 milliliters of water and the other had 100 milliliters of dry soil. Each container was placed in the sun for 20 minutes and then in the shade for 20 minutes. Which container, A or B, had the dry soil? Explain how the graph helped you decide which container had the dry soil.|A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.|A. Because the little things help me. All I know A is the dry soil.|incorrect|: When dry soil heats, it emits infrared radiation which warm up other materials around the dirt. So quickly the small points show all those thinginess happen very fast and we experience that as hotter than something else immediate before or after bare out.
Below is a drawing of a river that carried sand, clay, and pebbles (past the river's mouth) to a lake. Why is the clay deposited where you indicated?|The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.|The clay is like wet sand and it is by the river.|incorrect|: There is one layer of clays nestled in between the layers of sand and pebble.
Tabby made 2 solutions using the same solute and water. [Cup one has 6 spoons solute in 50 milliliters water. Cup 2 has 8 spoons solute in 50 milliliters water. Both solutions are clear with material on the bottom.] Which sentence below describes the concentrations of the 2 solutions? (A. The solutions in the cups have the same concentration.) B. Cup one has the more concentrated solution. C. Cup 2 has the more concentrated solution. D. There is not enough information to answer the question. Explain your choice.|Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.|If you take the same amount of water and weight it will measure to the same things.|correct|: Both cups have the same volume of a saturated solution. The spoonfuls, in themselves don't add or subtract from that concentration
Maggie wanted to find out if surface area affected temperature change. She had 3 white cake pans. She filled each with 300 milliliters of water. She put one small black plastic disk in pan A, 2 in pan B, and 3 in pan C. Then she put all 3 pans in the sun. When Maggie measured the water temperature in each pan after 15 minutes, which pan do you think held the hottest water? Explain your answer.|C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.|C. When there are more than one thing it get hotter faster and cooler faster too.|incorrect|:
Jana and Emily used indophenol to test 3 beverages for vitamin C. The number of drops they added to make a 10 milliliter sample of the blue indophenol indicator become colorless are given here: 8 drops of Overly Orange 13 drops of Luscious Lemon 33 drops of Fruitsnap (and it still didn't change color). Does Overly Orange or Luscious Lemon contain a higher concentration of vitamin C? What is the evidence?|Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.|I think Overly Orange juice because it took less drops.|correct|: The student got this question correct because he or she saw that Overly Orange took fewer drops to change the color. This observations shows there is more vitamin C (since it changed very quickly) in an orange juice concentrate called "Overly Orange." There are many varieties of vitamins, so students knew they couldn't just
Nigel made solutions in the bottles as shown below. Solution A was 2 spoons solute in 50 milliliters water and was clear with no material on the bottom. Solution B was 4 spoons solute in 100 milliliters water and was clear with no material on the bottom. Nigel took 50 milliliters of solution from bottle A and put it in cup A and 50 milliliters of solution from bottle B and put it into cup B. He put the cups on each side of the balance. Which picture shows what would happen? A is heavier than B, B is heavier than A, (A and B are the same weight). Explain your choice.|The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.|B has more solute than A does therefore B will weigh more since the solute is equally spread.|incorrect|: When two solutions that have the same concentration and contain near equal quantities of solute and solvent weigh different, then there can be one or more explanations: Temperature affects density; humid air weighs less than dry air Glassware may vary in size (due to created during manufacturing). A scale with a sensitivity setting below 0.
Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla pulled the string tighter?|When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.|It will change the pitch.|incorrect|: As the string is pulled tightly, a shorter length of it meets resistance against Darla's hand. The faster doorknob vibrates more quickly and therefore makes less time to complete one vibration as where there was enough space for its end' s downward movement from stroking up again repetitively during yank until coming
Emily evaporated a solution and drew a picture of the crystals that remained. Using the crystal-shape key below, what was dissolved in the solution? A. Epsom salt (B. alum) C. sodium thiosulfate.  Explain why you chose that answer.|The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.|I chose this answer because I remember what type it is because I remembered.|incorrect|: The crystal shape shows that the solute is an ionic compound or a salt.
Don wanted to find out if a battery powered toy truck would always travel the same distance in 10 seconds no matter how heavy a load the truck carried. He placed one or more blocks (the load) in the back of the truck and recorded his results. (Each block had the same mass.) The following graph displays his results. What is the relationship between the number of blocks and the distance traveled by the truck in 10 seconds?|The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.|As the number of blocks increases the distance decreases.|correct|: The more blocks a truck carries, the greater burden on its motor and battery. This creates less motion with each push of the remote control button .
Kurt was investigating which objects stick to magnets. He made an entry in his science notebook and drew a picture to help explain what he did. Look what I did! I picked up a paperclip with a magnet. Then that paperclip picked up another one, and then another one. And they weren't hooked together either. All they had to do was touch each other. Explain to Kurt why he was able to pick up all those paperclips, even though the magnet was only touching the first one.|When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.|The magnet magnetized the first one, then it a temporary magnet and then the next one.|correct|: I like to call this entry Kurt's 8th experiment
Look at the finger patterns below, then answer the questions. What is the same about the finger patterns?|Both finger patterns are loops.|They are loop.|correct|: The teacher repeats the target pattern with exaggerated mouth movements, pauses and cueing gestures to get students attention using listener-based cues. After several iterations of listening activity for this question "Look at the finger patterns above then answer me what's same about them" TAC 1 chk cnf
Pam and her family were planning a hike. Pam found 2 maps of the same area. Her friend recommended she use the topographic map when they went to the lake. Why would Pam's friend recommend using the topographic map for the hike?|She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.|It so it better to hike. A has more lines.|incorrect|: Students think that a map showing where there are lakes and elevations is best for hiking. By modeling the snow, sand & water lesson we can make explicit why this idea isn't correct: A topographic or topo (topographical) maps doesn't tell me were the ground of our feet might get wet It
Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?|When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.|It would be a high pitch.|incorrect|: 1.Tthe string longer, the wavelength is shorter. 2 T note pitched lower| Ex|two long coils of wire vibrating between two magnet poles rob at a difference frequency from one short coil Q[One inch rope has 1000 feet so if it had 1043 feet would have opepold
