    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.213.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it is big at beginning then slowly gets smaller and branches out.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.216.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it goes happy valley then the river.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.223.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it does not go into the mountain.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.225.1" accuracy="incorrect">The river flows from biggest to smallest. That is why.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.253.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because rivers sometimes end in valleys.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.262.1" accuracy="incorrect">The delta.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.357.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the water flow to the basin which is the rose mountains.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.667.1" accuracy="correct">It flows in that direction because the water is going high land to low land.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.668.1" accuracy="incorrect">Maybe because the mountains are that way, or there are cracks and the water goes through.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.670.1" accuracy="correct">Because the mountain is the highest peak and water flows downhill.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.673.1" accuracy="correct">I think that because the water flows down from the mountain first.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.684.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because there are little slots that take them that way.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.707.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think it flows that way because rivers usually flow from valleys into mountains.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.734.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think the water flows in that direction because the river is still trying to find the easiest route.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.753.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the earth's gravitational pull.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.768.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the river leads to an open delta.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.769.1" accuracy="incorrect">It flows in that direction because the mountain usually carries the water down the side of the mountain.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.776.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think the water flows in that direction because water cannot flow uphill.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.779.1" accuracy="incorrect">Rivers usually flow through valley. It grow weaker at the mountain because it cannot go uphill.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.787.1" accuracy="incorrect">There are other little streams at that end that was formed by water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.788.1" accuracy="correct">Rivers cannot flow up mountain and valleys cannot be on mountain so it is flowing towards happy valley.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.802.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think that way, because the water will flow down the mountain, not up it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.807.1" accuracy="incorrect">All the streams flow together forming one bigger river.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.810.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think this because the stream is getting wider as it goes on.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.811.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because that is downhill.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.817.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think it flows there because the river eroded the valley and the water would be flowing down the valley.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.819.1" accuracy="incorrect">The river gets the water from the mountain and takes it to happy valley.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.827.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think the water flows in the direction because that is where the crack is.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.840.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think flows in that direction because it starts small and it gets bigger.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.34b.844.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think the water flows in that direction because water cannot flow up a mountain.</studentAnswer>
