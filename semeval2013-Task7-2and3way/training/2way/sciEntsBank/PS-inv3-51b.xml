    <studentAnswer id="PS.51b.145.1" accuracy="correct">Which side has more string is a lower pitch. Whichever side has more string it has a lower pitch.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="PS.51b.154.1" accuracy="correct">Because when you give it less room to vibrate it makes a higher pitch.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="PS.51b.171.1" accuracy="correct">It got a higher pitch.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="PS.51b.176.1" accuracy="correct">It is a high pitch.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="PS.51b.524.1" accuracy="correct">The shorter the the higher the pitch because it less to travel through.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="PS.51b.531.1" accuracy="correct">And the shorter the string also the higher pitch it makes.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="PS.51b.539.1" accuracy="correct">The shorter the string the higher the sound.</studentAnswer>
