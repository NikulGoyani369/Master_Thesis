  <questionText>Grace set up a science experiment. Here's what she wrote in her notebook. First I put eggshells into a cup and covered them with vinegar. After a while, small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshells. The next day there were more bubbles. In a couple of days, the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear. I think I made a solution and a reaction. Explain why Grace thinks she made a solution.</questionText>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.136.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because first she put eggshells then the next day she made a solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.146.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because bubble came out of the eggshell.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.151.1" accuracy="correct">I think she made a solution because the eggshells and bubbles disappeared.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.185.1" accuracy="correct">She made a solution because she said that the water was clear and that is a solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.248.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think she did a solution because it had bubbles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.261.1" accuracy="correct">Because the eggshells were gone.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.285.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it was clear.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.304.1" accuracy="incorrect">That is because a solution is clear that you could see through.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.359.1" accuracy="correct">She made a solution because the eggshells had disappeared and it cannot be separated.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.364.1" accuracy="correct">Because the eggshells were gone and the water was left, inside was clear that why she thinks that she made a solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.385.1" accuracy="incorrect">It was a reaction because it fizz and bubble up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.392.1" accuracy="correct">The mixture was clear and eggshell was gone.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.393.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because bubbles are one sign of a gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.419.1" accuracy="correct">She thinks she made a solution because the eggshell dissolved in the vinegar and bubbled up and turned clear.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.432.1" accuracy="correct">Because the eggshell was gone and it was clear.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.437.1" accuracy="incorrect">Grace mixed 2 materials together and the solution ended up clear.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.439.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because she thinks that the eggshells and the water reaction and she think during the reaction the eggshell dissolved.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.453.1" accuracy="correct">She thinks she made a solution because the solute dissolved and the water is clear.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.469.1" accuracy="correct">Grace thinks she made a solution because first she put eggshells into a cup and covered them up with vinegar and then small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshell and a couple of days the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.473.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes because she saw the gas on and the vinegar was clear.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.496.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because a solution is when a solute and a solvent are mixed and she did that.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.503.1" accuracy="correct">Because she put eggshells in a cup and covered them with vinegar and after a couple of days she saw that they were gone.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.504.1" accuracy="incorrect">The eggshells dissolved a solution is when the solvent dissolve.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.531.1" accuracy="incorrect">The vinegar destroyed the eggshells.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.540.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because he used something that can make it bubble.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.543.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think Grace thinks she made a solution because she mixed eggshells and vinegar together.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.562.1" accuracy="correct">Because at the end the eggshell was gone and the water was clear.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.568.1" accuracy="correct">Grace thinks she made a solution because the eggshells disappeared into the liquid.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.571.1" accuracy="correct">I think the reason why Grace thinks she made a solution is because the eggshells went away after awhile.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.572.1" accuracy="correct">I think she did make a solution because a solution is when 2 or more materials are mixed together and one disappears into the other.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.576.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it turned into a clear liquid solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.592.1" accuracy="incorrect">She thinks the water was clear, which it was so it was a solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.596.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because there were more bubbles everyday.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.601.1" accuracy="correct">Because she said the water was clear. When water is clear then it is a solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.626.1" accuracy="correct">It is a solution because the eggshells disappeared leaving liquid clear making a solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.36a.635.1" accuracy="correct">Because she mixed the vinegar with the eggshells and later bubbles started to show up then it cleared.</studentAnswer>
