  <questionText>Ms. Teridann, a geologist, made a chart showing the scratch-test data for 3 minerals (Mineral X, Mineral Y, and Mineral Z). She wrote "yes" if the tool scratched the mineral and wrote "no" if it did not scratch it. Topaz is a mineral that cannot be scratched by a fingernail, a penny, or a paperclip. How hard is topaz compared to minerals X, Y, and Z? Explain how you know.</questionText>
