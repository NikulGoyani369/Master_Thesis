  <questionText>Anne is investigating which objects stick to magnets. She recorded this in her notebook. I was surprised! A nail was stuck to the magnet. When I accidentally touched the nail to a paperclip, the paperclip stuck to the nail. If Anne touched the nail to a brass ring, what do you think would happen and why?</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="ME_5b-a1">The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.</referenceAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="ME.5b.140.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would not go on the nail because a brass key has no magnetism in it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.5b.143.1" accuracy="correct">Fall off because they have no iron in them.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.5b.146.1" accuracy="correct">No because brass ring does not have iron in it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.5b.155.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think it would not stick because it is a plastic and it cannot do that.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.5b.159.1" accuracy="incorrect">It will not stick to the nail because of the brass ring is not made of metal.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="ME.5b.192.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think the nail would stick to it because the nail will still have the magnetic force.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.5b.214.1" accuracy="incorrect">If she touched it to a brass ring it would not stick because copper does not stick to a magnet.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="ME.5b.216.1" accuracy="incorrect">It would not stick and fall on the ground.</studentAnswer>
