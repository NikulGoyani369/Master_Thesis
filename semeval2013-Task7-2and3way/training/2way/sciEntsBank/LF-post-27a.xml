  <questionText>The change in elevation between contour line A and contour line B is 20 meters. What is the change in elevation between contour line A and contour line C? How do you know that is the change in elevation between A and C?</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="LF_27a-a1">40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.</referenceAnswer>

  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.391.1" accuracy="correct">40, Because between each is 20 and if you times 20 twice you will get 40.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.393.1" accuracy="correct">40, C is next to B so you add 20 meters to the elevation contour line band A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.400.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, The contour interval is 20 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.404.1" accuracy="incorrect">225, You keep adding 75.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.405.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it is the its spread apart.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.408.1" accuracy="incorrect">60 meters, Because it said the change in elevation from line A to B is 20 meters so that lets me know to count by 20 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.421.1" accuracy="correct">40, Because it is 20 thought A to B and B to C.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.427.1" accuracy="incorrect">283 meters, Because A is higher.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.436.1" accuracy="incorrect">45, Because you can tell by the lines.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.437.1" accuracy="incorrect">25 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.444.1" accuracy="incorrect">30 meters, I measured with my fingers that C was half of B, and since B is 20 and half of that is 10 I added both of them together and got 30 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.446.1" accuracy="incorrect">360, big the line of the A, B, C, D.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.452.1" accuracy="incorrect">C, Because it said the change in elevation for A and B was 20 meters and since it 20 they might be counting by 20's so that is my answer.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.462.1" accuracy="correct">40, because if it is like then to get to C just add another 20 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.468.1" accuracy="incorrect">30, well because if A and B equals 20 meters and B true C looked like 10 more meters and I think is 30 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.471.1" accuracy="incorrect">30, I know because A and B is 20 meters and B to C is about 10 meters and it is almost close together.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.481.1" accuracy="incorrect">30, because if you could change A on B so you A and C.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.487.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, now I know is if A to B is 20 meters than A to C is 40 because you add another.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.492.1" accuracy="incorrect">A, they are closer to each other.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.497.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, Because the contour numbers or lines are counting by 20 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.499.1" accuracy="incorrect">60 meters, you are just doubling it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.501.1" accuracy="incorrect">60 meters, I labeled them. I also knew C is the third letter in the alphabet so I counted by 20 3 times.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.507.1" accuracy="incorrect">30 meters, Because if you look at A and then C. C get a lower amount by subtracting.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.510.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, I know this because A to B is 20 meters and the next contour line is another 20 meters away it must be 40 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.512.1" accuracy="incorrect">Feet, because it has a great space between.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.517.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, I know this because the contour interval is 20 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.664.1" accuracy="incorrect">40 meters, each line goes up 20 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.668.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, It is counting by 20's, 0, 20, 40, 60.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.676.1" accuracy="incorrect">40 meters, It is on an accurate scale.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.850.1" accuracy="incorrect">30, I halved what A and B was.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.855.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, I know this because contour intervals do not change and 20 plus 20 equals 40.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.856.1" accuracy="incorrect">50 meters, It is double the length of B plus 10 meters.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.873.1" accuracy="incorrect">23 meters, I know because all you do is draw a line to line C.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.906.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, I know because the distance between contour lines do not change.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.922.1" accuracy="correct">40, I know because the distance between every line is 20, since 20 plus 20 equals 40.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="LF.27a.937.1" accuracy="correct">40 meters, I know because the contour line is 20. So since A and B is 20 add 20 more.</studentAnswer>
