    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer414" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb25-l2.qa113" accuracy="incorrect">A is in it"s own path with the battery. B and C are also in their own path. However, the path</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer413" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb26-l2.qa112" accuracy="correct">There are 2 paths.  Bulb A is on its own path, and thus will never affect bulbs B and C.  Meanwhile,  bulbs B and C share the same path and are thus dependent on each other.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer413" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb27-l2.qa112" accuracy="contradictory">bulb A is contained entirely in it"s own closed circuit. bulbs B and C are contained in the same closed circuit, therefore, affecting each other when burned out.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer414" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb28-l2.qa112" accuracy="incorrect">Bulb A is on its own closed path and bulbs B and C are on the same closed path</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer413" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb29-l2.qa113" accuracy="contradictory">A is on its own complete circuit, but B and C are on their own same complete circuit. so if bulb B or C is damaged it would upset the other since they are on the same closed circuit</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer412" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb31-l2.qa112" accuracy="correct">bulb a is in a closed path with the battery, so it is not affected by other bulbs. bulb c and b are in a closed path with each other, so they depend on the other to be lit.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb32-l2.qa112" accuracy="correct">Bulb A has its own path so no bulb will affect it.  But Bulb B and Bulb C are on the same path so if one goes out the other will too.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer414" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb34-l2.qa113" accuracy="incorrect">Bulb A is in its own closed path with the battery. Bulb B and bulb C are in their own closed path with the battery.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer413" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb35-l2.qa114" accuracy="incorrect">Bulb A is on it"s own path with the battery. Bulb B and C are contained on the same path with the battery, so if one goes out then both go out.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer412" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb36-l2.qa112" accuracy="correct">for the path that only contains bulb A it doesnt matter if the other 2 are on or off. for the second path both B and C share a path so if one goes out so does the other, but bulb A does not effect them.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer413" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb37-l2.qa113" accuracy="correct">B and C are on the same path so each one affects the other. A is own its own path so it will not affect the others</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer413" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb38-l2.qa112" accuracy="correct">There are two series involved in this diagram, therefore two different paths for the current to take. Bulbs B and C are contained in the same path and affect each other when one is burned out, but Bulb A is on its own path and only affects itself.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer412" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb39-l2.qa112" accuracy="correct">The path to bulb A is not in the same path as bulbs B and C.  Bulbs B and C are in the same path, so if one of the bulbs is out, so is the other.  Bulb A does not affect the other bulbs, nor is it affected by the other bulbs.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer413" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb40-l2.qa112" accuracy="contradictory">When bulb a is burnt out then b and c still have a contained path. when bulb b is burnt out then c does not have a direct path yet a does. when bulb c is burnt out then b does not have a contained paht but a does</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer413" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb41-l2.qa113" accuracy="contradictory">Bulb A is a direct closed pathway to the battery, and if it is burned out or damaged, so is every other bulb. If bulb B is damaged, only bulb C is affected because it is on the same pathway as bulb B and vise versa.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer412" id="SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb42-l2.qa112" accuracy="correct">Bulbs B and C are contained in the same path, so the status of these bulbs will affect each other and have no affect on bulb A. Bulb A is on its own path, so it will not have an affect on bulbs B and C.</studentAnswer>
