  <questionText>Joanne mixed material R and material D together, added water, and stirred. After a few minutes, the liquid was clear and there was a solid on the bottom of the cup. Joanne used a paper filter to separate the solid from the liquid. Why does the solid stay in the filter when the liquid goes through?</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="MX_42a-a1">The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.</referenceAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.101.1" accuracy="correct">The solid was too big to go through the filter paper.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.106.1" accuracy="correct">Because the little piece of the liquid and the undissolved is bigger.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.126.1" accuracy="incorrect">It is separate because the paper filter is liquid.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.172.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the solid is too heavy to go through the paper.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.291.1" accuracy="correct">Solid is too big to go through the filter hole. Liquid is just water that can go through almost anything.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.389.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the filter cannot hold the water because the filter already has water in it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.394.1" accuracy="correct">The holes in the filter are smaller than the solid particles, and the water particles are smaller than the holes, so the water goes through the filter while the solid will not go through.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.397.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the particle size was too big and the filter could not hold any more water because it was wet.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.423.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because when the solid touches the side, it sticks.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.432.1" accuracy="correct">Because the solid was bigger than the liquid so it got stuck!</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.448.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because she did not wet the filter and when she put the water they got wet.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.452.1" accuracy="correct">Because the materials are too big to go through the holes but the water is not too big to go through the holes in the filter.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.453.1" accuracy="incorrect">It stays in the filter because the solid material does not count as the solution.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.454.1" accuracy="correct">The solid does not go through the filter like the liquid because the liquid is small enough to go through the filter but the solid is too large.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.458.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it is a thick.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.462.1" accuracy="correct">Because the holes in the filter are too small for the solid to go through them.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.466.1" accuracy="correct">The solid stayed in because it was too big to go through the microscopic holes in the filter paper.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.470.1" accuracy="correct">The solid stays in the filter because the particles are too big to go through but dissolved can go through because the particles are small enough.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.472.1" accuracy="correct">It stays at the top because it is too big to go through the filter and the water is just a liquid.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.473.1" accuracy="incorrect">The solid is hard. It cannot go through because it is not a liquid.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.490.1" accuracy="correct">Because the solute in the saturated solution dissolved and were dispersed equally. The material that did not go through was too big to go through.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.497.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the materials are stuck together with water and cannot go through the tiny holes in the filter.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.502.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because when the water goes through the filter some water stays which helps the filter catch the sugar.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.524.1" accuracy="correct">Because it is too thick to slide down the filter.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.532.1" accuracy="correct">Because the solid stay because it is too big and water it can just go through things like that.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.540.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because they are big.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.543.1" accuracy="incorrect">The solid stayed in because it was not as watery and it was bigger chucks. The liquid is watery and so it went through.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.559.1" accuracy="incorrect">The solid stays in the filter because the filter's holes are too small for the liquid to go through.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.562.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because paper absorbent and solids cannot go through solids.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.563.1" accuracy="incorrect">The liquid was too big to go through the holes.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.567.1" accuracy="correct">Because in the filter paper there are little holes!</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.568.1" accuracy="correct">The solid would be too big to pass through the small holes in the filter paper.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.575.1" accuracy="correct">The solid stays because its particle size was too large to go through the filter.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.596.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because water goes through the paper and the salt is not water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.604.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the liquid is a substance that can go through most objects with small or tiny holes and solid cannot.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.42a.607.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the solid did not dissolve.</studentAnswer>
