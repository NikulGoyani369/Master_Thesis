  <questionText>When Amy added water to a mixture of baking soda and citric acid, the mixture began fizzing. Amy concluded there was a chemical reaction because it fizzed. Why is fizzing evidence of a chemical reaction?</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="MX_19-a1">The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.</referenceAnswer>

  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.387.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because when it fizzing it releases a gas. When a gas forms from 2 materials it is a gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.390.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the baking soda and citric acid started out plain but when you poured water in it reacted.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.392.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it shows and once you see it you will know that it is a chemical reaction because it starts to look like little bubbles and that is what a chemical reaction is.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.423.1" accuracy="correct">Because it indicates something else is produced.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.425.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the chemicals clash and fizz.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.426.1" accuracy="correct">Because It means that it is a gas or new material!</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.432.1" accuracy="correct">It created a gas and new material was made.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.438.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the 2 solutes and the solvent made a gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.439.1" accuracy="correct">It indicates a gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.453.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the bubble makes the solution or mixture different.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.454.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it was letting out gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.459.1" accuracy="incorrect">Gas was in it so that why it start fizzing.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.463.1" accuracy="correct">It is a clue because it is making a gas and that is a clue so you know that a chemical reaction is about to happen.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.464.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because you made a gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.467.1" accuracy="correct">Because a chemical reaction creates gas bubbles or a precipitate.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.469.1" accuracy="incorrect">It was fizzing because when he a mix baking soda and citric acid together the fizzing have meant that it dissolved and made bubbles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.473.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it shows that something other than just doing nothing.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.487.1" accuracy="correct">Because something has to happen for the precipitate to be made.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.492.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because fizzing is created by gas bubbles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.494.1" accuracy="correct">Because fizzing is a sign of gas leaving a material and that is a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.496.1" accuracy="correct">Because when it does that you know that you have made gasses and gasses are made when chemical reactions occur.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.500.1" accuracy="incorrect">Fizzing is a reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.501.1" accuracy="correct">Sometimes because fizzing means that gas is escaping and that is a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.502.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because if it was just water it would not fizz.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.560.1" accuracy="correct">Because when it fizzes there is gas and that is a sign of a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.563.1" accuracy="correct">It is evidence because it made gas and fizzing occurs only when one material does not like the other one.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.564.1" accuracy="correct">Fizzing evidence of a chemical reaction because when it fizzes it means it is producing gas.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.575.1" accuracy="correct">It is a chemical reaction because it made a gas and a gas only appears if there is a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.595.1" accuracy="incorrect">Something happened so it is a reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.597.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because fizzing is a reaction and so it had to be a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.604.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because you are putting 2 mixtures together so when it starts fizzing that is how you know it is a chemical reaction.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.605.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it did something.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.608.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it fizzed and moved so that is how.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.612.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it is bubbling and bubbling is a reaction when you mix stuff together and it bubbles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.626.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because when more than 2 chemicals are mixed it produces fizzing.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.19.635.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the material before did not use to fizz until they were put together.</studentAnswer>
