<h1>Joint Semeval Task 7 and RTE-8 challenge data format information</h1>

<h2>Common Format - Core Data</h2>

<p> The "rte-style" training data are separated into 2-way and 3-way
  subsets. The 5-way educational task subset is released separately on
  the main page, and contains some extra resources such as dependency
  parses that participants are free to use if they wish to.
</p>

<p>Withink the RTE-8 subset, the data are separated into "Beetle" and
  "SciEntsBank" directories, corresponding to the corpus from which
  they were drawn. Participants are free to train on these either
  separately or jointly; because the data origin is different
  (interaction with a tutoring system vs. lab notebooks), the systems
  may be scored separately on the different corpora in the final
  evaluation
</p>

<p> Data for each corpus is separated into one XML file per
question. Each file contains one top level <tt>question</tt> element
containing, in order, a <tt>questionText</tt> element,
a <tt>referenceAnswers</tt> element and a <tt>studentAnswers</tt>
element.</p>

<div class="highlight_box">
<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;question qtype="Q_EXPLAIN_GENERIC" id="VOLTAGE_DEFINE_Q"
          stype="QUESTION"
          module="FaultFinding"&gt;
    &lt;questionText&gt;What is voltage?&lt;/questionText&gt;
    &lt;referenceAnswers&gt;
        &lt;referenceAnswer category="BEST" id="answer244" fileID="VOLTAGE_DEFINE_Q_ANS1"&gt;Voltage is the difference in electrical 
        states between two terminals&lt;/referenceAnswer&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/referenceAnswers&gt;
    &lt;studentAnswers&gt;
        &lt;studentAnswer id="FaultFinding.VOLTAGE_DEFINE_Q.sbj3-l1.qa213" dialogue_id="sbj3-l1"
                     accuracy="unknown"
                     answerMatch="answer244"
                     count="1"&gt;is the difference between two terminals&lt;/studentAnswer&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/studentAnswers&gt;
&lt;/question&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p> All <tt>question</tt> elements contain a ID unique to the
  question, and a module name, which defines the general "topic" of
  the question. The range of modules/topics is described on the task
  web page.

<p>The <tt>questionText</tt> element contains the full text of the
question as text content.</p>

<p>The <tt>referenceAnswers</tt> element contains an arbitrary number
of <tt>referenceAnswer</tt> elements, one for each correct answer to
the question. The data coming from <em>SciEntsBank</em> corpus lists exactly
one of these answers for every question, but the <em>Beetle</em>
corpus may have multiple corerct answers, each with a category
attribute (containing BEST, GOOD, MINIMAL, or KEYWORD) and fileID
attribute that allows the answer to be referenced from
a <tt>studentAnswer</tt> element.</p>

<p>The <tt>studentAnswers</tt> element contains an arbitrary number
of <tt>studentAnswer</tt> elements, one for each student attempt to
answer the question.</p>

<p>Each <tt>studentAnswer</tt> element has text content which is the
text of the student answer, and an <b><tt>accuracy</tt></b> attribute
containing one of three
  values: <tt>correct</tt>, <tt>contradictory</tt> (3-way data only),
  and <tt>unknown</tt>.
such that:

<ul>
<li>a) the student answer and question text together entail one of the
  reference answers = "correct"</li>
<li>b) the student answer and question text together contradict one of the
  reference answers = "contradictory" (or "unknown" in 2-way data)</li>
<li>e) otherwise (the answer is partially correct, irrelevant, or does
  not address the scientific concepts) = "non_domain"</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer</b> all accuracy labels are assigned with respect to
correspondence with reference answer.  Extra material is ignored.</p>
