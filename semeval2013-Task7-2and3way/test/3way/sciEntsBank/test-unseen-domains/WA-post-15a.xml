    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.173.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water looks like it does because plain water is supposed to turn into a dome when it is on a flat surface.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.177.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water can stick together much better because nothing is breaking it up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.179.1" accuracy="incorrect">It causes it to look like that because it has no soap in it and soap makes water flat.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.181.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain looks like that because of water surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.184.1" accuracy="incorrect">It is called a dome and it forms a round like in the water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.190.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water looks like this because it is all water and has nothing more dense in it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.193.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water looks like that because it is just plain water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.195.1" accuracy="incorrect">Surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.196.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water is like a dome because it does not have soap in it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.206.1" accuracy="incorrect">Surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.207.1" accuracy="incorrect">It looks like that because there is surface tension around the water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.208.1" accuracy="incorrect">It causes it to look like that because it has no chemicals in it to fall apart like when you add soap to it, it breaks.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.209.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water does not have any soap.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.210.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it is normal water and it does not have anything in it.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.245.1" accuracy="correct">What causes the plain water to look like it does is surface tension. Surface tension is the skin like that holds the water together.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.246.1" accuracy="incorrect">Surface tension causes it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.248.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water has no soap in it to break its bubble.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.249.1" accuracy="incorrect">It looks like that because of the surface tension it has.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.251.1" accuracy="incorrect">Surface tension makes it look like that.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.252.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water looks like that because of surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.257.1" accuracy="correct">A skin like surface called surface tension that forms over the water causes it to bead up into a dome like drop.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.260.1" accuracy="correct">The has surface tension and that makes the water hold together in a dome shape.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.262.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the plain water has more texture than the soapy water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.263.1" accuracy="correct">Nothing breaking the surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.264.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it is denser than the soapy water.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.280.1" accuracy="correct">The plain water has a skin like tension. It is called surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.281.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because it is just water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.282.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water has a more stable skin.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.286.1" accuracy="correct">The plain water has a way bigger dome than soapy water. Surface tension causes the plain water to look like that.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.287.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because plain water has a surface area.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.288.1" accuracy="incorrect">The plain water forms that because of the surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.295.1" accuracy="correct">Plain water forms a dome because of the surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.297.1" accuracy="incorrect">Water forms together the water just formed together and made a dome.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.626.1" accuracy="incorrect">Condensation is the thing that forms the water to rise, condensation causes it to look like it does.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.627.1" accuracy="correct">Surface tension keeps it beaded up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.629.1" accuracy="incorrect">The surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15a.631.1" accuracy="incorrect">Its very light ingredients.</studentAnswer>
