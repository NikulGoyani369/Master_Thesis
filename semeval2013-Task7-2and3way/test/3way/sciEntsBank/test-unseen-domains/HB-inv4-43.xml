  <questionText>During class Corey used the falling cup tool to check how fast he could move his hands and feet. Corey found that he couldn't move his right foot as fast as he could move his right hand. Use what you know about stimulus response time to explain why his right hand is faster than his right foot.</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="HB_43-a1">The right hand is faster than the right foot because the foot is farther from the brain. Therefore the message to respond takes longer to reach the foot than the message takes to reach the hand.</referenceAnswer>
