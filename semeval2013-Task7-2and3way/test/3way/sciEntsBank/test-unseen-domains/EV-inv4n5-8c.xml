  <questionText>Rachael tried to hatch brine shrimp under a range of salty conditions (different amounts of salt from 0 to 9 milliliters in the same amount of water). (The graph shows that no eggs hatched in the 0 milliliters and 9 milliliters salt solutions). Rachael thinks that the unhatched brine shrimp eggs in environments outside the range of tolerance for salt might still be viable. Describe how she could find out.</questionText>
