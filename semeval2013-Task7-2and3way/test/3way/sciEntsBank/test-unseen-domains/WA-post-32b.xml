    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.171.1" accuracy="correct">Because X had more room to evaporate and Y did not.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.172.1" accuracy="correct">The water in container X had a more open space to evaporate, so it evaporated. The water in container Y could not evaporate because it did not have an open space to evaporate.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.173.1" accuracy="correct">X evaporated more than Y because container X has more surface area than container Y so it evaporated faster.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.174.1" accuracy="correct">There is more surface area on container X so more water could evaporate at one time.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.175.1" accuracy="correct">The water in X evaporated because the more surface area the more air can get to it to make it evaporate faster.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.176.1" accuracy="correct">X evaporated faster because it has more space to evaporate quicker.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.182.1" accuracy="correct">The water in container X evaporated more quickly than the water in container Y because in container X there is more wide and open, so the water evaporated faster, but since the container for cup Y was closed and not open very much, then the water evaporated slower.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.193.1" accuracy="correct">The water in container X evaporates faster because the container has more surface area.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.32b.198.1" accuracy="correct">X because X has more surface area and if you have lots of surface area it will evaporate faster.</studentAnswer>
