  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.172.1" accuracy="correct">The soapy water got flat because the soap in it broke its surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.173.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because soapy water is denser than plain water It looks kind of flat.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.174.1" accuracy="correct">The soapy water breaks the surface tension and forms a puddle.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.176.1" accuracy="correct">Well the water and the air form but then the soap comes and it is too slippery so it breaks the surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.177.1" accuracy="incorrect">The soapy water has little soap molecules that breaks in up and the water cannot stick together as well.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.178.1" accuracy="incorrect">Some of the particles are dirty and broke down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.179.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because soap moves around water so it can make the water flat.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.183.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the soap would hold it down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.185.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the person did put soap on it and so it made the dome turn flat.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.186.1" accuracy="correct">The soap broke the surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.187.1" accuracy="incorrect">The soapy water has soap in it. So the soap pull the drop down and made it flat.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.188.1" accuracy="correct">The soap breaks the surface tension which makes the water spill.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.190.1" accuracy="incorrect">The soapy water looks like it does because it has something more dense than water which is soap.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.191.1" accuracy="correct">The soapy water has a lot of soap so I do not think it has a lot of water tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.194.1" accuracy="contradictory">The soapy water has a lot of weight so the water spreads but still stays in one bead.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.195.1" accuracy="incorrect">Soap.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.208.1" accuracy="incorrect">The chemicals in the soap made that drop break and fall to the ground.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.210.1" accuracy="incorrect">Well the soapy water has water in it.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.218.1" accuracy="incorrect">The soap.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.219.1" accuracy="correct">The soapy water look like that because it does not have surface tension like the plain water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.220.1" accuracy="correct">The soap breaks the surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.221.1" accuracy="incorrect">Maybe because of the bubbles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.225.1" accuracy="correct">Surface tension broke because of soap.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.258.1" accuracy="incorrect">What causes the soapy water to look how it is because there is chemicals is soap so there is chemicals in the water to make it look how it is.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.260.1" accuracy="correct">The soap in the water makes the surface tension go away so it is flatter.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.262.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because the soapy water has less texture.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.263.1" accuracy="correct">Soap breaks the surface tension that is why it looks like that.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.267.1" accuracy="incorrect">It has soap and has water combined with it.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.15b.280.1" accuracy="correct">The soapy water does not have surface tension but plain water does.</studentAnswer>
