  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.24b.142.1" accuracy="incorrect">The surface is flat so the water beads up.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.24b.147.1" accuracy="incorrect">It gets a lot of water and makes a dome.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.24b.162.1" accuracy="correct">Surface tension.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.24b.171.1" accuracy="incorrect">Some forces tension makes the water to slip off the car.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.24b.173.1" accuracy="incorrect">The property is maybe the fact that palm held spray bottle right above the car. The closer the spray is to the car the bigger the bead forms.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.24b.177.1" accuracy="incorrect">The water sticks together and forms a bubble the water on the outside of the bubble is like skin.</studentAnswer>
