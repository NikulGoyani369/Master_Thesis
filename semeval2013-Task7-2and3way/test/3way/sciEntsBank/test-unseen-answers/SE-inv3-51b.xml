    <referenceAnswer id="SE_51b-a1">The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.</referenceAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="SE.51b.318.1" accuracy="correct">Because the triangles and containers are the same size and color they will both absorb the same amount of heat.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.51b.398.1" accuracy="correct">I think the same because it is the same size, same shape, same color. It is just placed differently in the container which would not have an impact.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.51b.497.1" accuracy="correct">They would be the same because they are the exact same size in the same position with the same size of containers.</studentAnswer>
