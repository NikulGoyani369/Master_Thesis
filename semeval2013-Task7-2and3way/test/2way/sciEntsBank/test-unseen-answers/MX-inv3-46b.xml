  <questionText>Nigel made solutions in the bottles as shown below. Solution A was 2 spoons solute in 50 milliliters water and was clear with no material on the bottom. Solution B was 4 spoons solute in 100 milliliters water and was clear with no material on the bottom. Nigel took 50 milliliters of solution from bottle A and put it in cup A and 50 milliliters of solution from bottle B and put it into cup B. He put the cups on each side of the balance. Which picture shows what would happen? A is heavier than B, B is heavier than A, (A and B are the same weight). Explain your choice.</questionText>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.385.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because they are equally concentrated and they both have some of water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.399.1" accuracy="correct">There is 2 times as much of the same solution in B as in A therefore equal volumes would weigh the same.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.455.1" accuracy="incorrect">Taking 50 milliliters from solution B would equal solution A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.46b.525.1" accuracy="incorrect">Solution B is just double solution A.</studentAnswer>
