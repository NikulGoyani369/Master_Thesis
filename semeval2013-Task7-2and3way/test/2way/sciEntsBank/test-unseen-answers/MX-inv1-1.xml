    <studentAnswer id="MX.1.532.1" accuracy="incorrect">I think it is because the salt was small enough and the sand was too big for it. The salt had gone away dissolved. Sand particles was too big.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.1.629.1" accuracy="correct">Because the salt fit through the holes in the filter.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.1.638.1" accuracy="incorrect">The salt is a smaller grain. The sand is more chunky and thicker so it not easy for it to go through.</studentAnswer>
