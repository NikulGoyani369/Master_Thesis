  <questionText>Don wanted to find out if a battery powered toy truck would always travel the same distance in 10 seconds no matter how heavy a load the truck carried. He placed one or more blocks (the load) in the back of the truck and recorded his results. (Each block had the same mass.) The following graph displays his results. What is the relationship between the number of blocks and the distance traveled by the truck in 10 seconds?</questionText>
