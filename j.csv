Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4., 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," <br>1. Voltage must travel in the same direction.<br><span style=""color:#CC0000"">The flow of electrons determines this.</span>.",1 Star,
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and terminal 6., 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," Answer had two incorrect elements; (1) The answer states that there is a gap of 1V between terminals 1 and 6. No mention was made about the type of resistors, only voltages for directionality were mentioned since resistor colors are used to establish polarity on schematics. And thereby changing their function",1 Star,
"Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.", 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect, no,1 Star,
"Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.", 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," Incorrect, actually it doesn't. the difference in voltage tells you that there is a break or gap somewhere wires are short to ground but if they were reversed then camera still shoot backcurrent would return through R1 solenoid holding bolt which rotates until this current reaches zero",1 Star,
"Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.", 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect,,1 Star,
Why do you think the other terminals are being held in a different electrical state than that of the negative terminal?,the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect, ,1 Star,
Why do you think those terminals and the negative battery terminal are in the same state?,the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect, INCORRECT.,1 Star,
Why do you think those terminals and the negative battery terminal are in the same state?,the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect, +,1 Star,
Why do you think those terminals and the negative battery terminal are in the same state?,the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," Incorrect Explanation: The previous clause was wrong, so Negative battery terminal is not ""not receiving any current"" because the brown wire of solenoid circuit receives present through Brown + trolley connects to red cable which runs close together above negative battery. Yes they are in the same state (doesn't matter) now",1 Star,
"As you move the multimeter leads from one bulb terminal to the next, what does it mean when the voltage reading jumps from 0 to 1.5?",the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," Incorrect, 10 out of 12 points awarded. Although one or both filaments are broken in a bulb or loose contact with its socket terminal it is unlikely that the 1/8 inch jump would be seen on an electronic meter but you can observe small voltage changes there between two end bulb terminals if any connected filament breaks down",1 Star,
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,I am gunatit,incorrect," **Correct, but needs elaboration**",first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,positive ,incorrect," The negative terminal of a battery receives more than one force. The most common was explained, but there is also another that will be worth checking with the teacher – not necessarily to confuse them! yes it's confused me too… check out this example: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2499557",first time,first time
