Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4., 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," <br>1. Voltage must travel in the same direction.<br><span style=""color:#CC0000"">The flow of electrons determines this.</span>.",1 Star,
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and terminal 6., 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," Answer had two incorrect elements; (1) The answer states that there is a gap of 1V between terminals 1 and 6. No mention was made about the type of resistors, only voltages for directionality were mentioned since resistor colors are used to establish polarity on schematics. And thereby changing their function",1 Star,
"Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.", 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect, no,1 Star,
"Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.", 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," Incorrect, actually it doesn't. the difference in voltage tells you that there is a break or gap somewhere wires are short to ground but if they were reversed then camera still shoot backcurrent would return through R1 solenoid holding bolt which rotates until this current reaches zero",1 Star,
"Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.", 1.5 for terminal 1 and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect,,1 Star,
Why do you think the other terminals are being held in a different electrical state than that of the negative terminal?,the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect, ,1 Star,
Why do you think those terminals and the negative battery terminal are in the same state?,the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect, INCORRECT.,1 Star,
Why do you think those terminals and the negative battery terminal are in the same state?,the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect, +,1 Star,
Why do you think those terminals and the negative battery terminal are in the same state?,the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," Incorrect Explanation: The previous clause was wrong, so Negative battery terminal is not ""not receiving any current"" because the brown wire of solenoid circuit receives present through Brown + trolley connects to red cable which runs close together above negative battery. Yes they are in the same state (doesn't matter) now",1 Star,
"As you move the multimeter leads from one bulb terminal to the next, what does it mean when the voltage reading jumps from 0 to 1.5?",the and danda dnd and the and negative the answers form user ,incorrect," Incorrect, 10 out of 12 points awarded. Although one or both filaments are broken in a bulb or loose contact with its socket terminal it is unlikely that the 1/8 inch jump would be seen on an electronic meter but you can observe small voltage changes there between two end bulb terminals if any connected filament breaks down",1 Star,
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,I am gunatit,incorrect," **Correct, but needs elaboration**",first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,positive ,incorrect," The negative terminal of a battery receives more than one force. The most common was explained, but there is also another that will be worth checking with the teacher – not necessarily to confuse them! yes it's confused me too… check out this example: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2499557",first time,first time

Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,abcd,incorrect," Incorrect - The diagram on the board does not correspond to this circuit.
Correct Explanation: A firm grasp of ""electrons flow"" concepts includes an understanding about voltage drops and potential difference . This question is a combination, including both conductors/wires carrying current PLUS two voltmeter readings where one value has",first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 2 and the positive terminal.,abcd,incorrect," It is now the exam takers turn to construct their own explanation to what they got wrong.
The problem arises though when students are not exposed to inquiry skills; where you take all your work one step further, keep asking questions and formulating logical explanations based on observations through questioning why this happened instead of simply accepting it",3 Star,abcd
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 6 and the positive terminal.,abcd,incorrect," This explanation is correct because in the above figure terminal 6 touches both battery terminals which measure voltage of 12 volts. Hence it can be said that there is no gap between positive and negative hence having same charge amounts on two sides measuring 2 x12=24V giving a voltmeter reading 0 for this reason
Explanation",4 Star,dada
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,I am gunatit,incorrect, + sign means goo d so there should be a positive terminal because +means *+,first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,hi how are you,incorrect," This is not accurate. Forgive my put down, but I wouldn't mind seeing this on the test either! There are no spaces between terminals 1 and 2 or terminal 3 and 4 . Only above ground connections can be considered open circuit conditions without continuity .",first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,and the positive terminal.,incorrect," targeting self-interpreted speaker meanings can be complex, especially when they are instead trying to explain observations made in the instructions.",first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 2 and the positive terminal.,and the positive terminal.,incorrect, terminal 2 is not connected to the positive terminal.,3 Star,the answaer is correct 
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal., reading of 1.5 ,incorrect," OK side of the battery is at -1.5 volts, but it's not on terminal 1; therefore correct",first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,dasnadas ,incorrect, N/A,first time,first time
Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.,dsaddasd,incorrect," Yes this is acceptable. You get 1.5 volts from the terminal you labeled T1 because it shares a positive return with other things in series too, such as motors which draw less current than lights for example",first time,first time
